For signatures with a small exponent such as 3 it is possible for an attacker to calculate a value for this extra data to make an altered message appear to be correctly signed, allowing the signature to be forged. Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS) library was vulnerable to this flaw. Because the set of root Certificate Authorities that ship with Mozilla clients contain some with an exponent of 3 it was possible to make up certificates, such as SSL/TLS and email certificates, that were not detected as invalid. This raised the possibility of the sort of Man-in-the-Middle attacks SSL/TLS was invented to prevent. We thank Philip Mackenzie and Marius Schilder for bringing this result to our attention and working with us to ensure the NSS library was safe from variations on this basic attack.

SSL clients such as Firefox and Thunderbird can suffer a buffer overflow if a malicious server presents a certificate with a public key that is too small to encrypt the entire \"Master Secret\". Exploiting this overflow appears to be unreliable but possible if the SSLv2 protocol is enabled. Servers that use NSS for the SSLv2 protocol can be exploited by a client that presents a \"Client Master Key\" with invalid length values in any of several fields that are used without adequate error checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow that presumably could be exploitable. Support for SSLv2 is disabled in Firefox 2 due to other known weaknesses in the protocol; Firefox 2 is not vulnerable unless the user has modified hidden internal NSS settings to re-enable SSLv2 support. Workaround Disable the SSLv2 protocol in any product that has not already done so. In Firefox 1.5: Click on the Advanced icon in the Options/Preferences dialog. On the Security tab uncheck the box next to \"Use SSL 2.0\" click the \"OK\" button. In Thunderbird 1.5: Click on the Advanced icon in the Options/Preferences dialog. Click the \"Config Editor...\" button. Type ssl2 in the Filter field Double-click security.enable_ssl2 to change the value to false and close the window.

Similarly, Michal Zalewski reported that although pages loaded from the web normally cannot open windows containing local files, if you could convince a user to open a blocked popup then this restriction could be bypassed. In order to take advantage of this flaw the attacker would have to know the full path to a locally-saved file containing malicious script.

This cannot be used for a direct same-origin violation to perform cross-site scripting: those checks are performed on the complete hostname including the nulls. However, other mechanisms rely on matching parent domains and those can be fooled by this trick. For example, this flaw allows a malicious page to set domain cookies for any arbitrary site, which might be useful in a session-fixation attack.

Cookies sent by an HTTP server are limited to a reasonable size by the general limit on the size of an HTTP header, but cookies created programmatically through JavaScript and added using document.cookie could have a path of any length the script could create -- potentially several tens of megabytes. The second issue was that the cookie path and name values were not checked for the presence of the delimiter used for internal cookie storage, and if present this confused future interpretation of the cookie data. Since the cookie host continued to be set correctly there was very little that could be done that the site could not legitimately set in the first place. One exception was the ability for a non-secure site to create \"secure\" cookies (it still could not read them), which might be a problem on some sites.

    "body": "The jar: URI scheme was introduced as a mechanism to support digitally signed web pages, enabling web sites to load pages packaged in zip archives containing signatures in java-archive format. Jesse Ruderman and Petko D. Petkov point out this means that sites that allow users to upload binary content in zip format are effectively allowing users to install web pages on their site, and these can be used to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The blogger at beford.org noted that redirects confused Mozilla browsers about the true source of the jar: content: the content was wrongly considered to originate with the redirecting site rather than the actual source. This meant that an XSS attack could be mounted against any site with an open redirect even if it didn't allow uploads. A published proof-of-concept demonstrates stealing the GMail contact list of users logged-in to GMail. Support for the jar: URI scheme has been restricted to files served with a Content-Type header of application/java-archive or application/x-jar. Web applications that require signed pages must make sure their .jar archives are served with this Content-Type. Sites that allow users to upload binary files should make sure they do not allow these files to have one of these two MIME types.",

When navigation occurs due to setting window.location the Referer header is supposed to reflect the address of the content which initiated the script. Instead, the referer was set to the address of the window (or frame) in which the script was running, and this vulnerability arises from that tiny difference. Using a modal alert() dialog Fleischer was able to suspend the attack script so that it did not load the target URI until after the attacker's initial content had been replaced by the intended referring page.

    "body": "Mozilla developer John G. Myers reported a weakness in the trust model used by Mozilla regarding alternate names on self-signed certificates (and those with mismatched names) that if accepted could be used to spoof a secure connection to any other site. This problem was independently reported by Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann. In Firefox 2 and earlier Mozilla-based browsers, when a user encounters a site with a self-signed certificate or one whose name does not exactly match the name in the certificate an error dialog is presented that allows the user to reject the certificate, or accept it as valid and access the site. There was no concept of partial trust, accepting the certificate as valid marked it as trusted for all information it contained, including alternate site names. These alternate names could be viewed as part of the certificate details, but since they were not present on the initial dialog many users could be fooled into accepting a certificate for a site they didn't care about (but wanted to see) that also asserted that it was a certificate for your bank or prominent online shop. Once accepted this certificate could be used to spoof that site or perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. The dialog has been changed in Firefox 2.0.0.15 to list the alternate names and users should not accept certificates that claim an unreasonable set of alternate names. Certificate handling in Firefox 3 is quite different and it was not susceptible to this vulnerability. In Firefox 3 there is no dialog to accept self-signed certificates, and when users do choose to make an exception to the SSL security model the certificate is only trusted for that one listed exception, not for any other site.",

Exploiting this vulnerability would involve first fooling the user into saving such a shortcut to a malicious site--typically from some other program since Firefox does not use this format--and then find the saved file on the desktop and choose to open it with Firefox. In affected pre-release versions of Firefox 3 the vulnerability was further mitigated by the additional restrictions on file content that prevent searching the local disk in this manner. Malicious scripts could only read from files with known names stored in the same folder (or sub-folder) as the shortcut.",

    "body": "Security researcher Billy Rios reported that if Firefox is not already running, passing it a command-line URI with pipe (\"|\") symbols will open multiple tabs. This URI splitting could be used to launch chrome: URIs from the command-line, a partial bypass of the fix for MFSA 2005-53 which was intended to block external applications from loading such URIs (that vulnerability remains fixed, however). This vulnerability could also be used by an attacker to pass URIs to Firefox that would normally be handled by a vector application by appending it to a URI not handled by the vector application. For example, web browsers normally handle file: URIs themselves, or block them from web content altogether, but this flaw enabled attackers to pass them from another browser into Firefox. In Firefox 2 scripts running from file: URIs can read data from a user's entire disk, a risk if the attacker could first place a malicious file in a guessable location on the local disk. Rios demonstrated that the so-called \"Safari Carpet-bombing vulnerability\" could be used for this, as well as another technique that does not rely on that now-fixed Safari vulnerability. In Firefox 3 scripts running in local files have limited access to other files, almost entirely mitigating the file: attack. However, combined with a vulnerability which allows an attacker to inject script into a chrome document the above issue could be used to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer. Such a chrome injection vulnerability was discovered in Firefox 3 by Mozilla developers Ben Turner and Dan Veditz. In the absence of the attack described by Billy Rios this injection attack would not run with any special privilege and would be at best a spoofing vulnerability. Workaround This attack only works if the user is using another internet-connected application with Firefox not running. Using Firefox, or making sure it is at least running, prevents this attack.",

These certificates could be used to intercept and potentially alter encrypted communication between the client and a server such as sensitive bank account transactions.

The vulnerability is triggered by a server by first redirecting a request for a plaintext resource to another resource behind a valid SSL/TLS certificate.

    "body": "Security researcher 3ric Johanson reported in discussions with Richard Newman and Holt Sorenson that Verisign's prevention measures for homograph attacks using Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) were insufficiently rigorous, and this led to a limited possibility for domain spoofing in Firefox. IDN allows non-English speakers to use domains in their local language. Many supported characters are similar or identical to others in English, allowing for the potential spoofing of domain names and for phishing attacks when not blocked. In consultation with Verisign, Mozilla had added .com, .net, and .name top-level domains to its IDN whitelist, allowing for IDN use in those top-level domains without restrictions. However, it became clear that a number of historical dangerous registrations continued to be valid. This issue has been fixed by removing the .com, .net, and .name top-level domains from the IDN whitelist, and supplementing the whitelist implementation with technical restrictions against script-mixing in domain labels. These restrictions apply to all non-whitelisted top-level domains. More information on the exact algorithm used can be found here.",

    "body": "Mozilla has updated the version of Network Security Services (NSS) library used in Mozilla projects to NSS 3.15.3 with the exception of ESR17-based releases, which have been updated to NSS 3.14.5. This addresses several moderate to critical rated networking security issues. Google developer Andrew Tinits reported a potentially exploitable buffer overflow that was fixed in both NSS 3.15.3 and NSS 3.14.5. Null Cipher buffer overflow (CVE-2013-5605) Mozilla developer Camilo Viecco discovered that if the verifylog feature was used when validating certificates then certificates with incompatible key usage constraints were not rejected. This did not directly affect Firefox but might affect other software using the NSS library CERT_VerifyCert can SECSuccess for bad certificates (CVE-2013-5606) Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy reported a runaway memset in certificate parsing on 64-bit computers leading to a crash by attempting to write 4Gb of nulls. Integer truncation in certificate parsing (CVE-2013-1741) Pascal Cuoq, RedHat developer Kamil Dudka, and Google developer Wan-Teh Chang found equivalent Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) library code suffered the same integer truncation. Avoid unsigned integer wrapping in PL_ArenaAllocate (CVE-2013-5607) NSS lowered the priority of RC4 in cipher suite advertisement so that more secure ciphers instead of RC4 are likely to be chosen by the server.

The second flaw is a \"low\" rated security issue affecting Desktop Firefox. In this attack, when a URL which is invalid for an internal protocol is pasted into the addressbar, the addressbar contents may be manipulated to show the location of an arbitrary website instead of the one currently loaded. This issue is mitigated by the protocol being prepended to the displayed URL, making the address less likely to be confused with the appended URL.
