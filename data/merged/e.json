    "body": "Recently two problems have been found in the glibc suite, which could beused to trick setuid applications to run arbitrary code.The first problem is the way ld.so handles environment variables: Inorder to provide a safe environment for setuid applications it removescertain the environment variables that can influence applicationexecution such as LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Unfortunately therewas a bug that could cause ld.so to not remove them under someconditions. This would affect setuid applications if they executeanother binary without dropping privileges or cleaning up theenvironment themselves.The second problem is the locale handling in glibc. glibc checks forcharacters like `/' in the LANG and LC_* environment variables to see ifsomeone is trying to trick a program into reading arbitrary files.Unfortunately there were some logic errors in those checks which couldbe used to make a setuid application use arbitrary files for localizationsettings, which can be exploited to trick it into executing arbitrarycode.These problems have been fixed in version 2.0.7.19981211-6.3 for Debian GNU/Linux 2.1(slink) and 2.1.3-13 for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (potato).

In a default configuration, Apache enables mod_dir, mod_autoindex, and mod_negotiation.

While it's normallyour strict policy to backport security bugfixes to older releases, thisturned out to be infeasible for Firebird 1.5 due to large infrastructuralchanges necessary to fix these issues. As a consequence security supportfor Firebird 1.5 is hereby discontinued, leaving two options toadministrators running a Firebird database: Administrators running Firebird in a completely internal setup with trusted users could leave it unchanged. Everyone else should upgrade to the firebird2.0 packages available at backports.org. Version 2.0.3.12981.ds1-6~bpo40+1 fixes all known issues. Please refer to the general backports.org documentation to add the packages to your package management configuration. These packages are backported to run with Debian stable. Since firebird2.0 is not a drop-in replacement for firebird2 (which is the source package name for the Firebird 1.5 packages) these updates are not released through security.debian.org. Corrections for potential future security problems affecting Debian stable will be released through backports.org as well. Arrangements have been made to ensure that Firebird in the upcoming Debian 5.0 release will be supportable with regular backported security bugfixes again.For a more detailed description of the security problems, please referto the entries in the Debian Bug Tracking System referenced above andthe following URLs:http://www.firebirdsql.org/rlsnotes/Firebird-2.0-ReleaseNotes.pdfhttp://www.firebirdsql.org/rlsnotes/Firebird-2.0.1-ReleaseNotes.pdfhttp://www.firebirdsql.org/rlsnotes/Firebird-2.0.2-ReleaseNotes.pdf",

    "body": "The recently announced vulnerability in Debian's openssl package(DSA-1571-1, CVE-2008-0166) indirectly affects OpenSSH. As a result,all user and host keys generated using broken versions of the opensslpackage must be considered untrustworthy, even after the openssl updatehas been applied.1. Install the security updates This update contains a dependency on the openssl update and will automatically install a corrected version of the libssl0.9.8 package, and a new package openssh-blacklist. Once the update is applied, weak user keys will be automatically rejected where possible (though they cannot be detected in all cases). If you are using such keys for user authentication, they will immediately stop working and will need to be replaced (see step 3). OpenSSH host keys can be automatically regenerated when the OpenSSH security update is applied. The update will prompt for confirmation before taking this step.2. Update OpenSSH known_hosts files The regeneration of host keys will cause a warning to be displayed when connecting to the system using SSH until the host key is updated in the known_hosts file. The warning will look like this:@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed. In this case, the host key has simply been changed, and you should update the relevant known_hosts file as indicated in the error message. It is recommended that you use a trustworthy channel to exchange the server key. It is found in the file /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub on the server; it's fingerprint can be printed using the command: ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub In addition to user-specific known_hosts files, there may be a system-wide known hosts file /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts. This is file is used both by the ssh client and by sshd for the hosts.equiv functionality. This file needs to be updated as well.3. Check all OpenSSH user keys The safest course of action is to regenerate all OpenSSH user keys, except where it can be established to a high degree of certainty that the key was generated on an unaffected system. Check whether your key is affected by running the ssh-vulnkey tool, included in the security update. By default, ssh-vulnkey will check the standard location for user keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/identity), your authorized_keys file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2), and the system's host keys (/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key). To check all your own keys, assuming they are in the standard locations (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, or ~/.ssh/identity): ssh-vulnkey To check all keys on your system: sudo ssh-vulnkey -a To check a key in a non-standard location: ssh-vulnkey /path/to/key If ssh-vulnkey says \"Unknown (no blacklist information)\", then it has no information about whether that key is affected. In this case, you can examine the modification time (mtime) of the file using \"ls -l\". Keys generated before September 2006 are not affected. Keep in mind that, although unlikely, backup procedures may have changed the file date back in time (or the system clock may have been incorrectly set). If in doubt, generate a new key and remove the old one from any servers.4. Regenerate any affected user keys OpenSSH keys used for user authentication must be manually regenerated, including those which may have since been transferred to a different system after being generated. New keys can be generated using ssh-keygen, e.g.: $ ssh-keygen Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa. Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. The key fingerprint is: 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 user@host5. Update authorized_keys files (if necessary) Once the user keys have been regenerated, the relevant public keys must be propagated to any authorized_keys files (and authorized_keys2 files, if applicable) on remote systems. Be sure to delete the lines containing old keys from those files.In addition to countermeasures to mitigate the randomness vulnerability,this OpenSSH update fixes several other vulnerabilities:CVE-2008-1483: Timo Juhani Lindfors discovered that, when using X11 forwarding, the SSH client selects an X11 forwarding port without ensuring that it can be bound on all address families. If the system is configured with IPv6 (even if it does not have working IPv6 connectivity), this could allow a local attacker on the remote server to hijack X11 forwarding.CVE-2007-4752: Jan Pechanec discovered that ssh falls back to creating a trusted X11 cookie if creating an untrusted cookie fails, potentially exposing the local display to a malicious remote server when using X11 forwarding.For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed inversion 4.3p2-9etch1. Currently, only a subset of all supportedarchitectures have been built; further updates will be provided whenthey become available.For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 4.7p1-9.We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages and take themeasures indicated above.",

This is caused by an incorrectDebian-specific change to the openssl package (CVE-2008-0166). As aresult, cryptographic key material may be guessable.This is a Debian-specific vulnerability which does not affect otheroperating systems which are not based on Debian. However, other systemscan be indirectly affected if weak keys are imported into them.It is strongly recommended that all cryptographic key material which hasbeen generated by OpenSSL versions starting with 0.9.8c-1 on Debiansystems is recreated from scratch. Furthermore, all DSA keys ever usedon affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes shouldbe considered compromised; the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on asecret random value used during signature generation.The first vulnerable version, 0.9.8c-1, was uploaded to the unstabledistribution on 2006-09-17, and has since that date propagated to the testing andcurrent stable (etch) distributions. The old stable distribution(sarge) is not affected.Affected keys include SSH keys, OpenVPN keys, DNSSEC keys, and keymaterial for use in X.509 certificates and session keys used in SSL/TLSconnections.

Here's a function prototype frominclude/saslutil.h to clarify my explanation:/* base64 encode* in -- input data* inlen -- input data length* out -- output buffer (will be NUL terminated)* outmax -- max size of output buffer* result:* outlen -- gets actual length of output buffer (optional)** Returns SASL_OK on success, SASL_BUFOVER if result won't fit*/LIBSASL_API int sasl_encode64(const char *in, unsigned inlen,char *out, unsigned outmax,unsigned *outlen);Assume a scenario where calling code has been written in such a way that itcalculates the exact size required for base64 encoding in advance, thenallocates a buffer of that exact size, passing a pointer to the buffer intosasl_encode64() as *out. As long as this code does not anticipate that thebuffer is NUL-terminated (does not call any string-handling functions likestrlen(), for example) the code will work and it will not be vulnerable.Once this patch is applied, that same code will break because sasl_encode64()will begin to return SASL_BUFOVER.For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixedin version 2.1.22.dfsg1-8+etch1 of cyrus-sasl2.For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed inversion 2.1.22.dfsg1-23+lenny1 of cyrus-sasl2 and cyrus-sasl2-heimdal.For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed inversion 2.1.23.dfsg1-1 of cyrus-sasl2 and cyrus-sasl2-heimdal.We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-sasl2/cyrus-sasl2-heimdal packages.",

Unfortunately, fixing this vulnerabilityis not possible without some changes in exim4's behaviour. If you use the -Cor -D options or use the system filter facility, you should evaluatethe changes carefully and adjust your configuration accordingly. TheDebian default configuration is not affected by the changes.The detailed list of changes is described in the NEWS.Debian file inthe packages. The relevant sections are also reproduced below.In addition to that, missing error handling for the setuid/setgidsystem calls allowed the Debian-exim user to cause root to append log data toarbitrary files (CVE-2011-0017).For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed inversion 4.69-9+lenny3.For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution(sid), these problem have been fixed in version 4.72-4.Excerpt from the NEWS.Debian file from the packages exim4-daemon-lightand exim4-daemon-heavy:Exim versions up to and including 4.72 are vulnerable toCVE-2010-4345. This is a privilege escalation issue that allows theexim user to gain root privileges by specifying an alternateconfiguration file using the -C option. The macro override facility(-D) might also be misused for this purpose.In reaction to this security vulnerability upstream has made a numberof user visible changes. This package includes these changes.If exim is invoked with the -C or -D option the daemon will not regainroot privileges though re-execution. This is usually necessary forlocal delivery, though. Therefore it is generally not possible anymoreto run an exim daemon with -D or -C options.However this version of exim has been built withTRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST=/etc/exim4/trusted_configs. TRUSTED_CONFIG_LISTdefines a list of configuration files which are trusted; if a configfile is owned by root and matches a pathname in the list, then it maybe invoked by the Exim build-time user without Exim relinquishing rootprivileges.As a hotfix to not break existing installations of mailscanner we havealso set WHITELIST_D_MACROS=OUTGOING. i.e. it is still possible tostart exim with -DOUTGOING while being able to do local deliveries.If you previously were using -D switches you will need to change yoursetup to use a separate configuration file. The \".include\" mechanismmakes this easy.The system filter is run as exim_user instead of root by default. Ifyour setup requies root privileges when running the system filter youwill need to set the system_filter_user exim main configurationoption.",

The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. There are four possible source implementations passed to the unmarshaller: DOMSource, StAXSource, SAXSource, StreamSource. For a DOMSource, the XML has already been parsed by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE. For a StAXSource, the XMLStreamReader has already been created by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE. For SAXSource and StreamSource instances, Spring processed external entities by default thereby creating this vulnerability. The issue was resolved by disabling external entity processing by default and adding an option to enable it for those users that need to use this feature when processing XML from a trusted source. It was also identified that Spring MVC processed user provided XML with JAXB in combination with a StAX XMLInputFactory without disabling external entity resolution. External entity resolution has been disabled in this case. For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in version 3.0.6.RELEASE-6+deb7u1.

These vulnerabilities, collectively known as ImageTragick, are the consequence of lack of sanitization of untrusted input.

The update disables the vulnerable coders (EPHEMERAL, URL, MVG, MSL, and PLT) and indirect reads via /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml file. In addition, we introduce extra preventions, including some sanitization for input filenames in http/https delegates, the full remotion of PLT/Gnuplot decoder, and the need of explicit reference in the filename for the insecure coders.

This update upgrades VLC in stretch to the new 3.x release series (as security fixes couldn't be sensibly backported to the 2.x series). In addition two packages needed to be rebuild to ensure compatibility with VLC 3; phonon-backend-vlc (0.9.0-2+deb9u1) and goldencheetah (4.0.0~DEV1607-2+deb9u1). VLC in jessie cannot be migrated to version 3 due to incompatible library changes with reverse dependencies and is thus now declared end-of-life for jessie. We recommend to upgrade to stretch or pick a different media player if that's not an option. For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in version 3.0.2-0+deb9u1.

This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set named Kernel Page Table Isolation, enforcing a near complete separation of the kernel and userspace address maps and preventing the attack. This solution might have a performance impact, and can be disabled at boot time by passing pti=off to the kernel command line. We also identified a regression for ancient userspaces using the vsyscall interface, for example chroot and containers using (e)glibc 2.13 and older, including those based on Debian 7 or RHEL/CentOS 6. This regression will be fixed in a later update. The other vulnerabilities (named Spectre) published at the same time are not addressed in this update and will be fixed in a later update.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Firefox has undergone significant internal updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For more information please refer to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/60.0esr/releasenotes/ In addition, the new Firefox packages require Rust to build. A compatible Rust toolchain has been backported to Debian stretch, but is not available for all architectures which previously supported the purely C++-based Firefox packages. Thus, the new Firefox packages don't support the armel, armhf, mips, mips64el and mipsel architectures at this point. For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in version 60.2.0esr-1~deb9u2. We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

An attacker could trigger it using crafted certificates with RSA keys with very small moduli. Verifying signatures with such keys would cause an integer underflow and subsequent heap buffer overflow resulting in a crash of the daemon. While arbitrary code execution is not completely ruled out because of the heap buffer overflow, due to the form of the data written to the buffer it seems difficult to actually exploit it in such a way.

    "body": "UEFI Secure Boot (SB) is a verification mechanism for ensuring that code launched by a computer's UEFI firmware is trusted. It is designed to protect a system against malicious code being loaded and executed early in the boot process, before the operating system has been loaded. SB works using cryptographic checksums and signatures. Each program that is loaded by the firmware includes a signature and a checksum, and before allowing execution the firmware will verify that the program is trusted by validating the checksum and the signature. When SB is enabled on a system, any attempt to execute an untrusted program will not be allowed. This stops unexpected / unauthorised code from running in the UEFI environment. Most x86 hardware comes from the factory pre-loaded with Microsoft keys. This means the firmware on these systems will trust binaries that are signed by Microsoft. Most modern systems will ship with SB enabled - they will not run any unsigned code by default, but it is possible to change the firmware configuration to either disable SB or to enrol extra signing keys. Debian, like many other Linux-based operating systems, uses a program called shim to extend that trust from the firmware to the other programs that we need to be secured during early boot: the GRUB2 bootloader, the Linux kernel and firmware update tools (fwupd and fwupdate).",
