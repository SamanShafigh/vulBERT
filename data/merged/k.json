Since CUPS contains xpdf code to convert incoming PDF files to the PostScript format, this vulnerability applies to cups as well. In this case it could even lead to privilege escalation: if an attacker submitted a malicious PDF file for printing, he could be able to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the CUPS server. Please note that the Ubuntu version of CUPS runs as a minimally privileged user ‘cupsys’ by default, so there is no possibility of root privilege escalation. The privileges of the ‘cupsys’ user are confined to modifying printer configurations, altering print jobs, and controlling printers. CAN-2004-1267: Ariel Berkman discovered a buffer overflow in the ParseCommand() function of the HPGL input driver. If an attacker printed a malicious HPGL file, they could exploit this to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the CUPS server. CAN-2004-1268, CAN-2004-1269, CAN-2004-1270: Bartlomiej Sieka discovered three flaws in lppasswd.

Any process was permitted to lock/unlock any System V shared memory segment that fell within the the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK limit (that is the maximum size of shared memory that unprivileged users can acquire). This allowed am unprivileged user process to unlock locked memory of other processes, thereby allowing them to be swapped out. Usually locked shared memory is used to store passphrases and other sensitive content which must not be written to the swap space (where it could be read out even after a reboot). CAN-2005-0177: OGAWA Hirofumi noticed that the table sizes in nls_ascii.c were incorrectly set to 128 instead of 256. This caused a buffer overflow in some cases which could be exploited to crash the kernel. CAN-2005-0178: A race condition was found in the terminal handling of the “setsid()” function, which is used to start new process sessions. http://oss.sgi.com/archives/netdev/2005-01/msg01036.html: David Coulson noticed a design flaw in the netfilter/iptables module. By sending specially crafted packets, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel or to bypass firewall rules. Fixing this vulnerability required a change in the Application Binary Interface (ABI) of the kernel. This means that third party user installed modules might not work any more with the new kernel, so this fixed kernel has a new ABI version number. You have to recompile and reinstall all third party modules.",

For reference, these are the details of the original USN: Jonas Sicking discovered that under some circumstances persisted XUL attributes are associated with the wrong URL. A malicious web site could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (MFSA 2006-35, CVE-2006-2775) Paul Nickerson discovered that content-defined setters on an object prototype were getting called by privileged UI code. It was demonstrated that this could be exploited to run arbitrary web script with full user privileges (MFSA 2006-37, CVE-2006-2776). Mikolaj Habryn discovered a buffer overflow in the crypto.signText() function. By sending an email with malicious JavaScript to an user, and that user enabled JavaScript in Thunderbird (which is not the default and not recommended), this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user’s privileges. (MFSA 2006-38, CVE-2006-2778) The Mozilla developer team discovered several bugs that lead to crashes with memory corruption. These might be exploitable by malicious web sites to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (MFSA 2006-32, CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780) Masatoshi Kimura discovered a memory corruption (double-free) when processing a large VCard with invalid base64 characters in it. By sending a maliciously crafted set of VCards to a user, this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user’s privileges. (MFSA 2006-40, CVE-2006-2781) Masatoshi Kimura found a way to bypass web input sanitizers which filter out JavaScript. By inserting ‘Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM)’ characters into the HTML code (e. g. ‘<scr[BOM]ipt>’), these filters might not recognize the tags anymore; however, Thunderbird would still execute them since BOM markers are filtered out before processing a mail containing JavaScript. (MFSA 2006-42, CVE-2006-2783) Kazuho Oku discovered various ways to perform HTTP response smuggling when used with certain proxy servers. Due to different interpretation of nonstandard HTTP headers in Thunderbird and the proxy server, a malicious HTML email can exploit this to send back two responses to one request. The second response could be used to steal login cookies or other sensitive data from another opened web site. (MFSA 2006-33, CVE-2006-2786) It was discovered that JavaScript run via EvalInSandbox() can escape the sandbox. Malicious scripts received in emails containing JavaScript could use these privileges to execute arbitrary code with the user’s privileges. (MFSA 2006-31, CVE-2006-2787)",

    "body": "Details It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain malformed image files. If a user or automated system using ImageMagick were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. Due to a large number of issues discovered in GhostScript that prevent it from being used by ImageMagick safely, the update for Ubuntu 18.10 and Ubuntu 19.04 includes a default policy change that disables support for the Postscript and PDF formats in ImageMagick. This policy can be overridden if necessary by using an alternate ImageMagick policy configuration.",
