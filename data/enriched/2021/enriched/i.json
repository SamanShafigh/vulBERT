The length of the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound.This possibly leads to memory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in a chain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.```185 void fill_mishblk(char* c, struct _mishblk* m)186 {187 memset(m, 0, sizeof(struct _mishblk));188 memcpy(m, c, 0xCC);```In the above code, the memory allocated for `c` may be shorter than 0xCC bytes.Upstream bug report :https://github.com/Lekensteyn/dmg2img/issues/11"

        "description": "Description Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz 2021-05-31 17:31:39 UTC When ptp4l is operating on a little-endian architecture as a PTP tranparent clock and forwards a one-step sync message, it generates a follow-up message which has an incorrect length, sending data past the message buffer. An attacker with access to the network can send a one-step sync message to cause an information leak or crash."
