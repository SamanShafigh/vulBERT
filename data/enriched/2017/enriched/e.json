This solution might have a performance impact, and can be disabled at boot time by passing pti=off to the kernel command line. We also identified a regression for ancient userspaces using the vsyscall interface, for example chroot and containers using (e)glibc 2.13 and older, including those based on Debian 7 or RHEL/CentOS 6.
