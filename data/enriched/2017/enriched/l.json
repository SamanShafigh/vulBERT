An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how GDI handles objects in memory and by preventing instances of unintended user-mode privilege elevation."

An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim's system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server. If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files. Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration."

The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted PDF content to such sites. Only Windows 10 systems with Microsoft Edge set as the default browser can be compromised simply by viewing a website. The browsers for all other affected operating systems do not automatically render PDF content, so an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim's system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server. If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files. Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release.

        "body": "NOTE This advisory was revised on July 10, 2018. Some content has been removed for simplicity and because it is no longer relevant. You can view the archived content for ADV180002 in the FAQ section following the Affected Products table. Microsoft is aware of a new publicly disclosed class of vulnerabilities referred to as “speculative execution side-channel attacks” that affect many modern processors and operating systems including Intel, AMD, and ARM. Note: this issue will affect other systems such as Android, Chrome, iOS, MacOS, so we advise customers to seek out guidance from those vendors. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities may be able to read privileged data across trust boundaries. In shared resource environments (such as exists in some cloud services configurations), these vulnerabilities could allow one virtual machine to improperly access information from another. In non-browsing scenarios on standalone systems, an attacker would need prior access to the system or an ability to run code on the system to leverage these vulnerabilities. Microsoft has released updates to help mitigate these vulnerabilities. To get all available protections, firmware (microcode) and software updates are required. This may include microcode from device OEMs and in some cases updates to AV software as well. In some cases, installing these updates will have a performance impact. We have also taken action to secure our cloud services. Microsoft has no information to indicate that these vulnerabilities have been used to attack customers at this time. Microsoft continues working closely with industry partners including chip makers, hardware OEMs, and app vendors to protect customers. This advisory addresses the following vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-5753 - Bounds check bypass CVE-2017-5715 - Branch target injection CVE-2017-5754 - Rogue data cache load Recommended Actions The best protection is to keep computers up to date. Please see Knowledge Base Article 4073757 for guidance on protecting Windows devices. Customers using Surface products should see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4073065. Enterprise customers are recommended to review this advisory in detail and register for the security notifications mailer to be alerted of content changes to this advisory. See Microsoft Technical Security Notifications. Software developers should review the C++ developer guidance for speculative execution side channels at https://aka.ms/sescdevguide. Verify the status of protections for CVE-2017-5715 and CVE-2017-5754 using the PowerShell script Get-SpeculationControlSettings. For more information and to obtain the PowerShell script see: Understanding Get-SpeculationControlSettings PowerShell script output. Potential performance impacts In testing Microsoft has seen some performance impact with these mitigations. For most consumer devices, the impact may not be noticeable; however, the specific impact varies by hardware generation and implementation by the chip manufacturer. Microsoft values the security of its software and services and has made the decision to implement certain mitigation strategies in an effort to better secure our products. In some cases, mitigations are not enabled by default to allow users and administrators to evaluate the performance impact and risk exposure before deciding to enable the mitigations. We continue to work with hardware vendors to improve performance while maintaining a high level of security. Advisory Details Vulnerabilities Description Speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities can be used to read the content of memory across a trusted boundary and can therefore lead to information disclosure. There are multiple vectors by which an attacker could trigger the vulnerabilities depending on the configured environment. For a detailed view of affected scenarios and Microsoft’s approach to mitigating this new class of vulnerabilities, please see our Security Research Blog. The following table summarizes the CVEs, names, and affected processors for each of these vulnerabilities: CVE Public Vulnerability Name Other Names Processors Affected CVE-2017-5753 Bounds check bypass Spectre, Variant 1 AMD, ARM, Intel CVE-2017-5715 Branch target injection Spectre, Variant 2 AMD, ARM, Intel CVE-2017-5754 Rogue data cache load Meltdown, Variant 3 ARM, Intel The first two variants, Bounds check bypass (CVE-2017-5753) and Branch target injection (CVE-2017-5715) are collectively known as Spectre. An attacker who has successfully exploited these vulnerabilities may be able to read privileged data across trust boundaries. In shared resource environments (such as exists in some cloud services configurations), these vulnerabilities could allow one virtual machine to improperly access information from another. In non-browsing scenarios on standalone systems, an attacker would need prior access to the system or an ability to run untrusted code on the system to leverage these vulnerabilities. In browsing scenarios, an attacker could convince a user to visit a malicious site to leverage these vulnerabilities to privileged information from the browser process such as sensitive data from other opened tabs. An attacker could also inject malicious code into advertising networks used by trusted sites or embed malicious code on a compromised, but trusted, site. Bounds check bypass store is an extension of Bounds check bypass. The third variant, Rogue data cache load (CVE-2017-5754) is known as Meltdown. An attacker who has successfully exploited this vulnerability may be able to read privileged memory from an unprivileged context. The following table summarizes the relevance of these variants to the attack scenarios and trust boundaries. Each attack scenario is described in terms of the direction that information flows when performing a speculative execution side channel attack. The entries for each CVE indicate whether the speculation primitive is applicable to the corresponding attack scenario.

If I am on the Security Only branch, what Security Only updates do I need to install to be protected from the vulnerabilities described in this advisory? Security Only updates are not cumulative. Depending on the operating system version you are using and the processor on the computer, you may need to install several security updates for full protection. In general, customers will need to install the January, February, March, and April updates. Systems based on AMD processors need an additional update as shown in the following table: Operating System version Security Update Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2 4338815 - Monthly Rollup 4338824 - Security Only Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (Server Core installation) 4284826 - Monthly Roll-up 4284867 - Security Only Windows Server 2008 SP2 4340583 - Security Update Microsoft recommends installing these Security Only updates in the order of release. 13. If I apply any of the applicable February security updates, will they disable the protections for CVE-2017-5715 like security update 4078130 did? No. Security update 4078130 was a specific fix to prevent unpredictable system behaviors, performance issues, and/or unexpected reboots after installation of microcode. Applying the February security updates on Windows client operating systems enables all three mitigations. On Windows server operating systems, you still need to enable the mitigations after proper testing is performed. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4072698 for more information. 14. I understand that Intel has released microcode updates. Where can I find and install these updates for my system? Microsoft is providing Intel microcode updates for Windows operating systems as they become available. Please see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4093836 for the current Intel microcode updates. 15. What are the mitigations for AMD processors for CVE 2017-5715, Branch Target Injection? The following table summarizes the attack scenarios that are protected against when the Windows Branch Target Injection mitigation is enabled and required hardware support is present on AMD CPUs: Scenario Mitigation Process-to-process scenarios where a malicious user-mode application could use CVE-2017-5715 to disclose the contents of memory used by other applications. Enabled by default User-to-kernel scenarios where a malicious user-mode application could use CVE-2017-5715 to disclose the contents of kernel memory. Disabled by default Virtualization scenarios where a compromised virtual machine could use CVE-2017-5715 to read the contents of privileged memory allocated to the host, hypervisor, or other guest virtual machine. Enabled by default By default, user-to-kernel protection for CVE-2017-5715 is disabled for AMD CPUs. Customers must enable the mitigation to receive additional protections for CVE-2017-5715. Enabling this mitigation may affect performance. The actual performance impact will depend on multiple factors, such as the specific chipset in your physical host and the workloads that are running. For details on how to enable this protection, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4073119 for Windows Client operating systems. For AMD CPUs that support SMT, further protection against attacks from sibling hardware threads is provided by STIBP enablement or turning off SMT. For additional details and AMD recommended mitigations please see AMD Security Updates and AMD Architecture Guidelines around Indirect Branch Control 16. I understand that AMD has released microcode updates. Where can I find and install these updates for my system? AMD recently announced they have started to release microcode for newer CPU platforms around Spectre variant 2 (CVE 2017-5715 Branch Target Injection). For more information refer to the AMD Security Updates and AMD White Paper: Architecture Guidelines around Indirect Branch Control. Microsoft will inform customers of AMD microcode updates for Windows operating systems as they become available. Please check back to this FAQ for updates. 17. I heard that CVE-2018-3693 (Bounds Check Bypass Store) is related to Spectre. Will Microsoft release mitigations for it? Bounds Check Bypass Store (BCBS) was disclosed on July 10, 2018 and assigned CVE-2018-3693. We consider BCBS to belong to the same class of vulnerabilities as Bounds Check Bypass (Variant 1). We are not currently aware of any instances of BCBS in our software, but we are continuing to research this vulnerability class and will work with industry partners to release mitigations as required. We continue to encourage researchers to submit any relevant findings to Microsoft’s Speculative Execution Side Channel bounty program, including any exploitable instances of BCBS. Software developers should review the developer guidance that has been updated for BCBS at https://aka.ms/sescdevguide. 18. I have an AMD-based device and I am experiencing high CPU utilization after installing the June or July Windows security updates or after installing a BIOS update for my device. Is this expected? There have been reports of high CPU utilization resulting in performance degradation on some systems with Family 15h & 16h AMD processors after installing June 2018 or July 2018 Windows updates from Microsoft and updated AMD microcode that addresses Spectre Variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715 - Branch Target Injection). AMD and Microsoft have investigated this issue, and Microsoft has released a solution in the August 18, 2018 Windows security updates for the following operating systems: Windows 10 version 1607 Windows 10 version 1709 Windows 10 version 1803 Windows 7 Service Pack 1 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server, version 1709 (Server Core Installation) Windows Server, version 1803 (Server Core Installation) Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 AMD and Microsoft have investigated this issue, and Microsoft has released a solution in the November 13, 2018 Windows security updates for the following operating systems: Windows 8.1 Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Remediation Guidance Customers who wish to remediate the performance impact caused by this issue may wish to consider temporarily disable Spectre Variant 2 mitigations via registry settings for Windows until a solution for this issue is released. When a solution is released for this issue, customers will need to re-enable the registry settings. Customers who disabled Spectre Variant 2 mitigations via registry settings for Windows will need to re-enable the registry settings. Note: We do not recommend that customers uninstall the June or July security updates for Windows because the June and July updates provide numerous other critical security fixes. Changing Registry Settings Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base article 322756[(https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756). Note Enabling or disabling the Spectre Variant 2 mitigation through registry setting changes requires administrative rights and a restart. To disable Spectre Variant 2 mitigations: reg add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management\" /v FeatureSettingsOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f reg add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management\" /v FeatureSettingsOverrideMask /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f Restart the computer for the changes to take effect. When the solution is available for your operating system, the registry keys will need to be re-enabled. To enable Spectre Variant 2 mitigations: reg add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management\" /v FeatureSettingsOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f reg add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management\" /v FeatureSettingsOverrideMask /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f Restart the computer for the changes to take effect. 19. Where can I find and install ARM64 firmware that mitigate CVE-2017-5715 - Branch target injection (Spectre, Variant 2)? Customers using 64-bit ARM processors should check with the device OEM for firmware support because ARM64 operating system protections that mitigate CVE-2017-5715 - Branch target injection (Spectre, Variant 2) require the latest firmware update from device OEMs to take effect. 20. What are the mitigations for ARM CPUs for CVE 2017-5715, Branch Target Injection? The following table summarizes the attack scenarios that are protected against when the Windows Branch Target Injection mitigation is enabled and required hardware support is present on ARM CPUs: Scenario Mitigation Process-to-process scenarios where a malicious user-mode application could use CVE-2017-5715 to disclose the contents of memory used by other applications.

Systems such as workstations and terminal servers where Microsoft Outlook is used at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this."

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office PowerPoint software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server. The attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change permissions, delete content, steal sensitive information (such as browser cookies) and inject malicious content in the browser of the victim. For this vulnerability to be exploited, a user must click a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted SharePoint Web App site. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an email message containing the specially crafted URL to the user of the targeted SharePoint Web App site and convincing the user to click the specially crafted URL. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted URL to the targeted SharePoint Web App site that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. There are many ways that an attacker could place a specially crafted file in a location that is scanned by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. For example, an attacker could use a website to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim's system that is scanned when the website is viewed by the user. An attacker could also deliver a specially crafted file via an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that is scanned when the file is opened. In addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server. If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file is scanned. If real-time scanning is not enabled, the attacker would need to wait until a scheduled scan occurs in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. All systems running an affected version of antimalware software are primarily at risk. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files. Note: Typically, no action is required of enterprise administrators or end users to install updates for the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, because the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates will apply the update within 48 hours of release. The exact time frame depends on the software used, Internet connection, and infrastructure configuration."
