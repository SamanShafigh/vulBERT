        "description": "Description Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala 2019-08-28 02:33:14 UTC As per upstream advisory:On a Samba SMB server for all versions of Samba from 4.9.0 clients are able to escape outside the share root directory if certain configuration parameters set in the smb.conf file.The problem is reproducable if the 'wide links' option is explicitly set to 'yes' and either 'unix extensions = no' or 'allow insecure wide links = yes' is set in addition.If a client has no permissions to enter the share root directory it will get ACCESS_DENIED on the first request. However smbd has a cache that remembers if it successfully changed to a directory. This cache was not being reset on failure. The following SMB request will then silently operate in the wrong directory instead of returning ACCESS_DENIED. That directory is either the share root directory of a different share the client was operating on successfully before or the global root directory ('/') of the system.The unix token (uid, gid, list of groups) is always correctly impersonated before each operation, so the client is still restricted by the unix permissions enfored by the kernel."

        "description": "Description Siddharth Sharma 2019-10-18 10:26:45 UTC As per upstream advisory:Samba client code (libsmbclient) returns server-supplied filenames to calling code without checking for pathname separators (such as \"/\" or \"../\") in the server returned names.A malicious server can craft a pathname containing separators and return this to client code, causing the client to use this access local pathnames for reading or writing instead of SMB network pathnames.This access is done using the local privileges of the client. This attack can be achieved using any of SMB1/2/3 as it is not reliant on any specific SMB protocol version.Specifically, samba client tools like smbget and smbclient's mget use the server supplied 'final' name component as a local name when obtaining multiple files. While the design of these tools is that server can always choose the file names, this vulnerability is that it allows a remote server to create local files outside the current working directory.Users of the libsmbclient library external to Samba may also be vulnerable if they use server returned filenames without adequate checking and pass them to functions that do local filesystem access.Note that the Gnome GVFS client library is not believed to be vulnerable, as it always passes server-returned pathnames back to the SMB share they were returned from. Such malformed pathnames are then rejected by the server.Upstream bug: https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14071"

        "description": "Description Mark Cooper 2020-01-16 04:58:59 UTC A possible privilege escalation has been found in containers which modify the permissions of their local /etc/passwd.Within a container by default a user is assigned to the root group: sh-4.2$ id uid=1001(default) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)When this is combined with a loosening of permissions on /etc/passwd, it is possible for any user in the container to modify the passwd file and assume root.For example: https://github.com/operator-framework/presto/blob/master/Dockerfile.rhel#L75 chmod -R 774 /etc/passwd $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts && To then add a new root user (in a contrived example): oc rsh presto echo test::0:0:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd su testAdditionally, as a result of OpenShift not implementing user namespaces as of yet, if root is achieved in the container - root is technically achieved on the host.It is our understanding that this chmod of /etc/passwd has have become necessary to support arbitrary user ids as per this document:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/openshift_images/create-images.html#images-create-guide-openshift_create-images The document does state, \"that there are no security concerns with this arrangement\", however from the above example we can see that this is not true.It should also be noted however, that containers in OpenShift do run under a restricted SCC context by default, with CAP_SETUID and CAP_SETGID both dropped. This increases the difficulty significantly to achieve access to the host directly. Even with protections like this (including SELinux), this technique provides a relatively easy first step in achieving a container escape and is still considered an escalation in privileges.The following containers so far have been identified to modify /etc/passwd: - hadoop - hive - jenkins-slave-base-rhel7 - openshift-enterprise-apb-base - openshift-enterprise-apb - openshift-enterprise-mediawiki - openshift-enterprise-tests - openshift-jenkins-2 - ose-metering-ansible-operator - presto - sso73-openshift"

        "description": "Description Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz 2019-11-07 16:55:32 UTC LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed macros can be executed on various script events such as mouse-over, document-open etc. Access is intended to be restricted to scripts under the share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python sub-directories of the LibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9852, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed by employing a URL encoding attack to defeat the path verification step. However this protection could be bypassed by taking advantage of a flaw in how LibreOffice assembled the final script URL location directly from components of the passed in path as opposed to solely from the sanitized output of the path verification step. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice 6.2 versions prior to 6.2.7; 6.3 versions prior to 6.3.1.References:https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/CVE-2019-9854/https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/17"
