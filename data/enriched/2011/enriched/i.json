The site's contents will be displayed.2) Exit the browser.3) Start Firefox again and visit the page you visited in step 1.

Middleware then checks for the token'spresence on form submission, and validates it.Previously, however, our CSRF protection made an exception for AJAXrequests, on the following basis: 1. Many AJAX toolkits add an X-Requested-With header when usingXMLHttpRequest. 2. Browsers have strict same-origin policies regarding XMLHttpRequest. 3. In the context of a browser, the only way that a custom header ofthis nature can be added is with XMLHttpRequest.Therefore, for ease of use, we did not apply CSRF checks to requests thatappeared to be AJAX on the basis of the X-Requested-With header. The Rubyon Rails web framework had a similar exemption.Recently, engineers at Google made members of the Ruby on Rails developmentteam aware of a combination of browser plugins and redirects which canallow an attacker to provide custom HTTP headers on a request to anywebsite. This can allow a forged request to appear to be an AJAX request,thereby defeating CSRF protection which trusts the same-origin nature ofAJAX requests.Michael Koziarski of the Rails team brought this to our attention, and wewere able to produce a proof-of-concept demonstrating the samevulnerability in Django's CSRF handling.To remedy this, Django will now apply full CSRF validation to all requests,regardless of apparent AJAX origin. This is technicallybackwards-incompatible, but the security risks have been judged to outweighthe compatibility concerns in this case.Additionally, Django will now accept the CSRF token in the custom HTTPheader X-CSRFTOKEN, as well as in the form submission itself, for ease ofuse with popular JavaScript toolkits which allow insertion of customheaders into all AJAX requests."

This is due to a chain overlay being set on the frontend, with a ppolicy configured with ppolicy_forward_updates. While this is not a security issue regarding LDAP contents, due to the authentication as an unprivileged anonymous user, when LDAP returns a successful bind to other external programs (such as programs performing authentication, such as pam_ldap or SSSD) it could allow a user to login with an invalid password (in that case, if LDAP is used for user authentication, it could lead to a successful login with an invalid password).This was already corrected upstream [4] for unrelated reasons.References:[1] http://www.openldap.org/its/index.cgi/Software%20Bugs?id=6607[2] http://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-technical/201004/msg00247.html[3] http://secunia.com/advisories/43331/[4] http://www.openldap.org/devel/cvsweb.cgi/servers/slapd/back-ldap/chain.c.diff?r1=1.76&r2=1.77&hideattic=1&sortbydate=0"

We can't create a buffer with kmalloc and free it later in the tcp ack path with put_page, so we need to either:1) ensure that when we create the list of pages, no page struct has PG_Slab set or2) not use a page list to send this dataGiven that these buffers can be multiple pages and arbitrarily sized, I think (1) is the right way to go. I've written the below patch to allocate a page from the buddy allocator directly and copy the data over to it. This ensures that we have a put_page free-able page for every entry that winds up on an skb frag list, so it can be safely freed when the frame is acked. We do a put page on each entry after the rpc_call_sync call so as to drop our own reference count to the page, leaving only the ref count taken by tcp_sendpages. This way the data will be properly freed when the ack comes inSuccessfully tested by myself to solve the above oops.Note, as this is the result of a setacl operation that exceeded a page of data, I think this amounts to a local DOS triggerable by an uprivlidged user, so I'm CCing security on this as well.\"Upstream commit:http://git.kernel.org/linus/e9e3d724e2145f5039b423c290ce2b2c3d8f94bcIntroduced in 4b580ee3 v2.6.13-rc4"

        "description": "Description Matt McCutchen 2011-02-04 00:21:09 UTC Wayne Davison and I have identified a memory safety bug in rsync >= 3.0.0, affecting the generator process (receiving side) when incremental recursion is on, --delete is on, and --owner is off. Under these conditions, some of the generator's deletion functions temporarily increment file_extra_cnt, a global variable that governs the in-memory format of file_structs, and restore the original value on completion. The increment was intended to only affect the temporary file lists used to implement deletion, but it can also affect incremental file-list chunks that happen to be received during a call to one of these functions, which will be created in the wrong format. When the original file_extra_cnt is restored, the value originally stored in each applicable OPT_EXTRA field will show up in the next one as listed in rsync.h.Most of the fields are opaque data or are validated upon use, so their corruption leads to incorrect results but no danger to rsync itself. However, rsync uses the invariant that the F_HL_PREV field (applicable when --hard-links is on) forms a linked list of file indices consistent with the FLAG_HLINK* flags. The movement of the F_HL_GNUM values (which can be chosen arbitrarily by the sender subject to some constraints) into the F_HL_PREV field has the potential to break memory safety.Upstream fix for the 3.0.x branch (sum of three commits):http://gitweb.samba.org/?p=rsync.git;a=commitdiff;h=83b94efa6b60a3ff5eee4c5f7812c617a90a03f6;hp=c8255147b06b74dad940d32f9cef5fbe17595239Upstream bug report (marked fixed, but a full explanation has not been posted due to the security implications):https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7936I would appreciate Red Hat's help in getting a CVE and determining the severity of the issue. In my testing, I have been able to make an rsync 3.0.7 generator incur valgrind errors and then segfault (details forthcoming), but we have neither confirmed nor ruled out arbitrary code execution."

        "description": "Description Vincent Danen 2011-05-23 21:01:10 UTC It was reported [1] that a flaw exists in how openSSL handles SSL renegotiation. Because of the processing power required to handle an SSL/TLS handshake, with renegotiation enabled, a user can send multiple handshakes per second due to the renegotiation request being permitted. This could allow a malicious user to send multiple renegotiation requests and exhaust server resources.Note that this is not the only way to cause a denial of service on an SSL-enabled service; there are many other ways to accomplish the same thing, this just makes it easier.What makes this bug even more confusing is that this report is recent, with a 2011 CVE, however the recommended fix in the report is to upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.8l, which is what disabled renegotiation, however it was subsequently re-enabled when OpenSSL added support for RFC5746 in OpenSSL 0.9.8m (which the reporter seems to imply isn't sufficient). I'm not sure where the CVE assignment came from; on MITRE's site is is reserved yet and I have not seen this discussed anywhere else but in a Nessus scan report [2].As an aside, and to reference something we may need to look at, there seems to be some concern with Apache and how it works with SSL renegotiation disabled [3], so we will need to look into cases where disabling SSL renegotiation may impact expected behaviour of currently released products.[1] http://orchilles.com/2011/03/ssl-renegotiation-dos.html[2] https://discussions.nessus.org/message/10629[3] http://old.nabble.com/TLS-renegotiation-disabling-%3A-mod_ssl-and-OpenSSL--0.9.8l-td26285568.html"

        "description": "Description Tomas Hoger 2011-01-07 14:51:17 UTC Following patch was applied to glibc packages to address dynamic linker privilege escalation issue CVE-2010-3847 (see bug #643306):https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3847#c26http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=4b646a51f13fd6816c483fb24c308a13264c6d1aThis change introduced a regression in handling of privileged programs that use $ORIGIN in R*PATH in the binary itself, or any of the depending libraries. When running such privileged program, this issue causes dynamic linker to not expand $ORIGIN in R*PATH and search for additional dynamic objects starting from the current working directory. This could allow a local user to escalate their privileges, or cause the program to fail to find required libraries.Prior to the CVE-2010-3847, it was possible to escalate privileges when privileged program had $ORIGIN in R*PATH. An attacker needed to have a write access to the file system hosting such binary, to be able to hard-link it to an attacker-controlled directory. Then the attacker could LD_PRELOAD malicious library from the same directory and execute code with elevated privileges. This flaw was of limited risk, as setuid/setgid binaries with $ORIGIN in R*PATH seem to be rare (there's no such binary in Red Hat Enterprise Linux).With the 4b646a51 fix applied, attacker no longer needs write access to the file system with privileged program, and the relative-to-CWD search can be triggered by R*PATHs of depending libraries too. Even with these loosened requirements, there are currently no privileged programs shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux known to be exploitable using this flaw.To address this issue, 4b646a51 was reverted and the following patch was applied in fedora glibc git branch:http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391ad8823ba58405325d78cefeae5cdf699Following patch is also required to avoid regressing CVE-2010-3847 fix:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3847#c22http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=22cd1c9bcf57c5829d65b6da825f7a459d40c9eb"

This can result in a kernel div-by-zero message and possible busywait during stap module shutdown. A div-by-zero could cause the kernel to panic and if the kernel reboot on panic flag was set (panic_on_oops), it would cause the system to reboot.In order to trigger this flaw, it would require a user with staprun or stapdev group membership (or root privileges) to run a particular stap script operation on a hand-corrupted elf program."

Recently, during the security audit, we discovered a bug inTorque server and pbs_iff (all versions) which can have seriousimplications to security. This is likely to lead attacker to elevate hisprivileges.Torque server does not check the length of \"job name\" argument beforeusing it - this string is verified only on the client side. It ispossible to use modified Torque client or DRMAA interface to submit jobwith arbitrary chosen job name in terms of length and content. Thus, itis possible to attacker to overflow buffer and overwrite some Torqueserver process internal data causing its specific behavior.Below are some technical details concerning x86_64 build:What can be overwritten is log_buffer global string array andall next symbols:0000000000734b00 B log_buffer0000000000738b00 B msg_registerrel0000000000738b08 B msg_manager0000000000738b10 B msg_startup10000000000738b18 B msg_momnoexec10000000000738b20 B msg_man_uns0000000000738b28 B msg_sched_nocall0000000000738b30 B msg_issuebad0000000000738b38 B stdout@@GLIBC_2.2.50000000000738b40 B msg_job_end_stat0000000000738b48 b dtor_idx.61470000000000738b50 b completed.61450000000000738b58 b acct_opened0000000000738b5c b acct_auto_switch0000000000738b60 b acctfile0000000000738b68 b acct_opened_day0000000000738b70 b spaceused0000000000738b78 b spaceavail0000000000738b80 b username.63600000000000738bc0 b groupname.6402Here I submit the crafted job:[bartol@bartek_torque torque-mod]$ echo /bin/date | ./src/cmds/qsub -Z\"Job_Name=`perl -e 'print \"A\"x16350'`\"It is possible now to see in debugger that structures adjacent tolog_buffer are overwritten with \"A\" chars (encoded as 0x41 numbers):Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.0x00000033550cd323 in __select_nocancel () from /lib64/libc.so.6(gdb) x/20x 0x0000000000738b000x738b00 <msg_registerrel>: 0x4141414141414141 0x41414141414141410x738b10 <msg_startup1>: 0x4141414141414141 0x41414141414141410x738b20 <msg_man_uns>: 0x4141414141414141 0x4141414141414141The overflow occurs in the following code:1560 sprintf(log_buffer, msg_jobnew,1561 preq->rq_user, preq->rq_host,1562 pj->ji_wattr[(int)JOB_ATR_job_owner].at_val.at_str,1563 pj->ji_wattr[(int)JOB_ATR_jobname].at_val.at_str,1564 pj->ji_qhdr->qu_qs.qu_name);We proved that server crash is easily possible (including databasedamage) and we think privilege escalation can be done with some moreeffort as well, but the latter is strongly dependable on particularbuild flags and architecture.The overflow is also possible in pbs_iff setuid binary, since the \"host\"variable length is not checked:sprintf(log_buffer,\"cannot resolve IP address for host '%s'herror=%d: %s\",hostname, /*1*/h_errno,hstrerror(h_errno));Please let us know if you need some additional information and whatare your plans concerning this issue.Bartlomiej BalcerekMaciej KotowiczAdam ZabrockiReproducible: AlwaysThis problem was reported to the EGI Software Vulnerability Group by Bartlomiej.Balcerek (Bartlomiej.Balcerek@pwr.wroc.pl) rather than found by the submitter. It has also been reported to the Torque providers, and been fixed by them - an e-mail from Douglas Wightman (wightman@adaptivecomputing.com) states:Dear Bartlomiej,Thank you for the email. I apologize that we did not reply sooner. Our Torque engineers have patched this vulnerability in the latest releases of Torque (2.4 and higher).We are working on getting you a new release that you can verify. Please expect a follow-up email soon.Thanks for your help with this issue and please continue to report all future issues that you may encounter.Thanks,- Douglas WightmanThis bug is being entered in order that a 'fixed' version of Torque is available in EPEL. The EGI http://www.egi.eu/ Software Vulnerability group http://www.egi.eu/policy/groups/Software_Vulnerability_Group_SVG.html runs a process for handling software vulnerabilities reported. While our work is primarily designed to handle vulnerabilities in Grid Middleware, other vulnerabilities found in software used in the EGI infrastructure may also be reported to us and we pass the information on to the software suppliers, as well as considering the risk to the EGI infrastructure."

        "description": "Description Eugene Teo (Security Response) 2011-06-13 05:25:24 UTC hfs_find_init() is wrongly assuming that sb->ext_tree has already been opened and is not NULL but this function can be called when sb->ext_tree is currently being opened (NULL deref).Indeed when we have the following call path, the NULL deref. occurs:In hfs_mdb_get() we have (at this stage ext_tree == NULL): HFS_SB(sb)->ext_tree = hfs_btree_open(sb, HFS_EXT_CNID, hfs_ext_keycmp);hfs_btree_open() is calling read_mapping_page() which is indirectly a call to hfs_readpage(). Then hfs_readpage() can make the following calls: hfs_readpage() -> hfs_get_block() -> alloc_buffer_head() -> hfs_ext_read_extent()Then hfs_ext_read_extent() calls hfs_find_init() with an ext_tree == NULL. Then we have a NULL dereference in hfs_find_init(). ptr = kmalloc(tree->max_key_len (...));Due to the huge call stack from hfs_btree_open() to hfs_find_init() there are many ways to fix this dereference but I can't find the proper way to fix it.Moreover if we look at the code in hfs_find_init(). 20 ptr = kmalloc(tree->max_key_len * 2 + 4, GFP_KERNEL); 21 if (!ptr) 22 return -ENOMEM; 23 fd->search_key = ptr; 24 fd->key = ptr + tree->max_key_len + 2;We can make \"max_key_len * 2 + 4\" wrap and have an fd->key pointing outside of the kmalloc()'ed space. Moreover we can make space in fd->search_key lower than max_key_len and bad things can occur.Reference:https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/6/8/154Acknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank Clement Lecigne for reporting this issue."

Although all fixed counters share the same config MSR, they each have their own counter register.Without: $ task -e unhalted_core_cycles -e instructions_retired -e baclears noploop 1 noploop for 1 seconds 242202299 unhalted_core_cycles (0.00% scaling, ena=1000790892, run=1000790892) 2389685946 instructions_retired (0.00% scaling, ena=1000790892, run=1000790892) 49473 baclears (0.00% scaling, ena=1000790892, run=1000790892)With: $ task -e unhalted_core_cycles -e instructions_retired -e baclears noploop 1 noploop for 1 seconds 2392703238 unhalted_core_cycles (0.00% scaling, ena=1000840809, run=1000840809) 2389793744 instructions_retired (0.00% scaling, ena=1000840809, run=1000840809) 47863 baclears (0.00% scaling, ena=1000840809, run=1000840809)Acknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank Li Yu for reporting this issue."

        "description": "Description Tomas Hoger 2011-08-01 09:48:32 UTC GDK's GIF image reader is based on David Koblas' code that is also used in several other GIF image readers. This code contained an input validation flaw. Input code size was read from input GIF file and used to initialize decoding tables without checking the value, leading to buffer overflow. Relevant GDK code is: 941 static int 942 gif_prepare_lzw (GifContext *context) 943 { ... 946 if (!gif_read (context, &(context->lzw_set_code_size), 1)) { 947 /*g_message (_(\"GIF: EOF / read error on image data\\n\"));*/ 948 return -1; 949 } ... 952 context->lzw_clear_code = 1 << context->lzw_set_code_size; ... 962 for (i = 0; i < context->lzw_clear_code; ++i) { 963 context->lzw_table[0][i] = 0; 964 context->lzw_table[1][i] = i; 965 }The same flaw was previously reported for several other components that include GIF reading code based on David Koblas' parser, such as: gd (CVE-2006-4484), SDL_image (CVE-2007-6697), tk (CVE-2008-0553), netbpm (CVE-2008-0554), cups (CVE-2008-1373).This problem was corrected upstream long ago:http://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk-pixbuf/commit/gdk-pixbuf/io-gif.c?id=3bac204e0d0241a0d68586ece7099e6acf0e9beaThe fix can be found in all gdk-pixbuf versions embedded in gtk2 packages, but it seems it never got it to stand-alone gdk-pixbuf version for gtk+ 1.x.Gimp corrected this bug ~2 years after GDK:http://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/commit/plug-ins/common/gifload.c?id=cac290d093d0c318bbe33a4ff290c2abbd9698d3"

Qsub provides submit host name to server (hidden way),which is used by server to authenticate request.Using subverted PBS_O_HOST parameter it is possible toomit at least three (of four) authorization mechanisms Torque uses:1) RCmd, using ruserok() function,2) \"submit_hosts\" server parameter,3) \"allow_node_submit\" server parameterAs for the 4th mechanism: ACL (\"acl_host_enable\" option) it is proofagainst such authorization bypass.The \"orighost\" is taken from settable on client side variable pbs_o_host:\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\": orighost = get_variable(pjob, pbs_o_host);Then three checks are performed to authorize submit host. Allrefer \"orighost\" variable.1)\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\": rc = ruserok(orighost, 0, owner, luser); if (rc != 0 && EMsg != NULL) { ... snprintf(EMsg, 1024, \"ruserok failed validating %s/%s from %s\", owner, luser, orighost);2)\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\": for (hostnum = 0;hostnum < submithosts->as_usedptr;hostnum++) { testhost = submithosts->as_string[hostnum]; if (!strcasecmp(testhost, orighost)) { /* job submitted from host found in trusted submit host list,access allowed */3)\"src/lib/Libsite/site_check_u.c\": if ((HostAllowed == 0) && (server.sv_attr[SRV_ATR_AllowNodeSubmit].at_flags &ATR_VFLAG_SET) && (server.sv_attr[SRV_ATR_AllowNodeSubmit].at_val.at_long == 1) && (find_nodebyname(orighost) != NULL)) { /* job submitted from compute host, access allowed */Proof if concept:1. Pick the site you want to check against vulnerability, check if itsport 15001 is open to you,2. Check its Torque version ,3. Choose a machine, that is not authorized to submit jobs, you musthave root access to this machine,4. Pick an appropriate Torque version fromhttp://www.clusterresources.com/downloads/torque/You can choose v. 2.3.6 to perform check against Torque server <= 2.4.125. Apply the attached patch e.g.:patch -p1 < torque-2.3.6-customargs.patch6. Configure and make e.g..:./configure --with-server-home=/opt/Torque-2.3.6/spool--prefix=/opt/Torque-2.3.6 --disable-server --disable-mommakemake install (from root account)7. Guess/choose any remote account name,8. Create an account of such name on your local machine, andperform next task using this account,9. Try to submit a job in regular way e.g.:echo /bin/sleep 100 | /opt/Torque-2.3.6/bin/qsub -q @<site address>At the end of the output you should see that your job was rejected:qsub: Bad UID for job execution MSG=ruserok failed validatingbartol/bartol from sec.wcss.wroc.pl10. Check PBS_O_HOST variable on \"Variable_List\" in qsub output.It should be changed to addres of valid \"submit host\". Server nameitself is good idea there.11. Submit a job with changed PBS_O_HOST on variable list e.g.:echo /bin/sleep 100 | /opt/Torque-2.3.6/bin/qsub -q @batch.wcss.wroc.pl-Z \"Variable_List=PBS_O_HOME=/home/bartol,PBS_O_LANG=pl_PL.utf8,PBS_O_LOGNAME=bartol,PBS_O_PATH=/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/NX/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/home/bartol/bin,PBS_O_MAIL=/var/spool/mail/bartol,PBS_O_SHELL=/bin/bash,PBS_SERVER=sec.wcss.wroc.pl,PBS_O_HOST=batch.wcss.wroc.pl,PBS_O_WORKDIR=/home/bartol\"The submission should succeed now.Reproducible: AlwaysThis bug has already been reported to the Torque providers and the EGI Software Vulnerability Group (SVG)The EGI http://www.egi.eu/ Software Vulnerability group http://www.egi.eu/policy/groups/Software_Vulnerability_Group_SVG.html runs a process for handling software vulnerabilities reported.

This implementation contains a bug in the LZW decompressor, causing it to in correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table. LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word may match the first free entry in the decompression table. The implementation used in this GIF reading code allows code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.This problem is identical to a bug found in BSD compress (CVE-2011-2895, bug #727624), but given the unclear relationship between BSD compress and GIF decoder code bases, separate CVE is used here.Several projects refer to pbmplus as the source form where GIF reading code was taken:http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/In pbmplus version of the code, the flaw can be found in LWZReadByte(): if (code >= max_code) { *sp++ = firstcode; code = oldcode; }This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an \"infinite\" loop: while (code >= clear_code) { *sp++ = table[1][code]; if (code == table[0][code]) pm_error(\"circular table entry BIG ERROR\"); code = table[0][code]; }where: #define MAX_LWZ_BITS 12 static int table[2][(1<< MAX_LWZ_BITS)]; static int stack[(1<<(MAX_LWZ_BITS))*2], *sp; sp = stack;This results in stack[] buffer overflow.

The clock ID is got from clock_getcpuclockid(1,&clock_id). 2) posix_cpu_clock_get() sets cpu_time_count->sched to task_struct->sched_time of PID#1 and calls sample_to_timespec().3) sample_to_timespec() divides cpu_time_count->sched by NSEC_PER_SEC using div_long_long_rem().4) The result of the division becomes bigger than 0xffffffff.5) Divide Error Fault occurs.The reason why Divide Error Fault occurs is the huge task_struct->sched_timeof PDI#1. When sys_clock_gettime() was called, task_struct->sched_time ofPID#1 was 0xfffffe4c5e3c58c2.The task_struct->sched_time is increased by update_cpu_clock() while handlinglocal timer interrupts as follows. ---static inline voidupdate_cpu_clock(struct task_struct *p, struct rq *rq, unsigned long long now){ p->sched_time += now - max(p->timestamp, rq->timestamp_last_tick);}---The 'now' argument is got from TSC and if it is nearly zero, p->sched_timebecomes very large. It can happen while system booting on which TSC isinitialized to zero as follows.--- init() \"init/main.c\" -> smp_prepare_cpus(max_cpus) -> synchronize_tsc_bp() -> write_tsc() => TSC is initialized to 0---So the summary of the problem is as follows:1) TSC is initialized to zero during system booting.2) update_cpu_clock() is called just after 1) then task_struct->sched_time of PID#1 becomes very large.3) sys_clock_gettime() is called for clock ID of PID#1.4) Divide Error Fault occurs."

As a result, if givena certificate containing rich text in its fields, it will render the richtext.Specifically, a certificate containing a common name (CN) that has a tableelement will cause the second line of the table to be displayed. This canallow spoofing of the certificate's common name.The vulnerability and technical information about the exploit wereprovided by Tim Brown of Nth Dimension.

Andy worked to create something a bit smaller and am pleased with the outcome. This code is modeled after the code that is currently upstream in vlan_do_receive. If skb->dev is not a valid VLAN interface, then we can stop processing and return control to __netif_receive_skb. We also set skb->pkt_type = PACKET_OTHERHOST so the frame is dropped in the stack quickly.Andy has tested this patch and confirmed that the panic is prevented and everything else works as expected. Sending frames with only a priority tag results in the frames being dropped (if a device with VID 0 is not created on the host), and he also did a packet capture and noted that priority tagged frames are properly displayed with tcpdump/wireshark.Acknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank Gideon Naim for reporting this issue."

When a header field is mangled using SetEnvIf, the new environment variable data can be multiples of the size of the submitted header field. This would cause ap_pregsub() to overflow the length value in buffer size calculations, leading to the subsequent allocation call of a too-small buffer. Filling this buffer with user-supplied data will lead to a buffer overflow.Depending on the input data, this can lead to excessive allocation of server memory (resulting in killed processes due to out-of-memory conditions), invalid memory access when copying large amounts of data (which can lead to a termination of the httpd process), or possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary code.To trigger this flaw, mod_setenvif must be enabled (the default) and the attacker needs to be able to place a crafted .htaccess file on the server (which, in most cases, would require local access to the file system or some web interface that allows for writing arbitrary files to the local file system, such as for custom .htaccess files).There is currently no upstream fix, however to work around the problem, disable mod_setenvif.[1] http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/"

        "description": "Description Vincent Danen 2012-03-14 20:23:45 UTC A flaw was reported [1] in Python's SimpleHTTPServer's list_directory() function. Due to a missing charset parameter, if a user were to connect to SimpleHTTPServer using IE7, which engages in encoding-sniffing and can be tricked into interpretting the output as UTF7. Because of this, an attacker could hide <script> tags in UTF7-encoded characters which do not get quoted by cgi.encode(), allowing XSS attacks.This has been corrected upstream in version 2.6.7rc2 [2], 2.5.6c1 [3]. It may be fixed in 2.7 as well, but I was unable to find a commit to match it against.[1] http://bugs.python.org/issue11442[2] http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release26-maint/Lib/SimpleHTTPServer.py?r1=66717&r2=88831&view=patch[3] http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release25-maint/Lib/SimpleHTTPServer.py?r1=53148&r2=88815&view=patch"
