        "body": "A design flaw (CVE-2010-4345)in exim4 allowed the local Debian-exim user to obtain root privileges byspecifying an alternate configuration file using the -C option or by using themacro override facility (-D option). Unfortunately, fixing this vulnerabilityis not possible without some changes in exim4's behaviour. If you use the -Cor -D options or use the system filter facility, you should evaluatethe changes carefully and adjust your configuration accordingly. TheDebian default configuration is not affected by the changes.The detailed list of changes is described in the NEWS.Debian file inthe packages. The relevant sections are also reproduced below.In addition to that, missing error handling for the setuid/setgidsystem calls allowed the Debian-exim user to cause root to append log data toarbitrary files (CVE-2011-0017).For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed inversion 4.69-9+lenny3.For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution(sid), these problem have been fixed in version 4.72-4.Excerpt from the NEWS.Debian file from the packages exim4-daemon-lightand exim4-daemon-heavy:Exim versions up to and including 4.72 are vulnerable toCVE-2010-4345. This is a privilege escalation issue that allows theexim user to gain root privileges by specifying an alternateconfiguration file using the -C option. The macro override facility(-D) might also be misused for this purpose.In reaction to this security vulnerability upstream has made a numberof user visible changes. This package includes these changes.If exim is invoked with the -C or -D option the daemon will not regainroot privileges though re-execution. This is usually necessary forlocal delivery, though. Therefore it is generally not possible anymoreto run an exim daemon with -D or -C options.However this version of exim has been built withTRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST=/etc/exim4/trusted_configs. TRUSTED_CONFIG_LISTdefines a list of configuration files which are trusted; if a configfile is owned by root and matches a pathname in the list, then it maybe invoked by the Exim build-time user without Exim relinquishing rootprivileges.As a hotfix to not break existing installations of mailscanner we havealso set WHITELIST_D_MACROS=OUTGOING. i.e. it is still possible tostart exim with -DOUTGOING while being able to do local deliveries.If you previously were using -D switches you will need to change yoursetup to use a separate configuration file. The \".include\" mechanismmakes this easy.The system filter is run as exim_user instead of root by default. Ifyour setup requies root privileges when running the system filter youwill need to set the system_filter_user exim main configurationoption."
