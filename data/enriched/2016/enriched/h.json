        "description": "CWE-325: Missing Required Cryptographic Step - CVE-2016-0701OpenSSL 1.0.2 introduced the ability to generate X9.42 style parameter files as required by RFC 5114. The primes generated in this mode may be 'unsafe', enabling generation of groups containing small subgroups, which may allow for cryptographic attacks that may recover the key. OpenSSL prior to 1.0.2f did not properly check for this possibility.Furthermore, OpenSSL prior to 1.0.2f will by default reuse this number for the life of the process. Such a number, particularly if re-used, severely weakens applications of the Diffie-Hellman protocol such as TLS, allowing an attacker in some scenarios to possibly determine the Diffie-Hellman private exponent and decrypt the underlying traffic.The researcher states in a blog post however that this attack \"requires that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer (OpenSSL in this case) uses the same private DH exponent.\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade') - CVE-2015-3197According to OpenSSL, \"A malicious client can negotiate SSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled on the server and complete SSLv2 handshakes even if all SSLv2 ciphers have been disabled, provided that the SSLv2 protocol was not also disabled via SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2.\"For more information, please see OpenSSL's security advisory.The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2016-0701.",

An attacker using \"DROWN\" may obtain the session key from a vulnerable server supporting SSLv2 and use it to decrypt any traffic encrypted using the shared certificate. It allows an attacker to decrypt intercepted TLS connections by making specially crafted connections to an SSLv2 server that uses the same private key.\"The SSLv2 protocol is the only protocol directly impacted; however, the researcher's website states that many servers may use a shared certificate between the SSLv2 and the newer TLS protocols. If so, if the certificate is decrypted via SSLv2, then the TLS protocol using the shared certificate can be decrypted as well. The attack requires approximately 1000 SSL handshakes to be intercepted for the attack to be effective.The researchers have also released a DROWN attack check tool and an FAQ that provides more complete information.",

This vulnerability involves different code paths than those used by CVE-2015-7979.CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing - CVE-2016-1548By spoofing packets from a legitimate server, an attacker can change the time of an ntpd client or deny service to an ntpd client by forcing it to change from basic client/server mode to interleaved symmetric mode.CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') - CVE-2016-1549ntpd does not prevent Sybil attacks from authenticated peers. An malicious authenticated peer can create any number of ephemeral associations in order to win ntpd's clock selection algorithm and modify a victim's clock.CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2016-1550ntpd does not use a constant-time memory comparison function when validating the authentication digest on incoming packets. In some situations this may allow an attacker to conduct a timing attack to compute the value of the valid authentication digest causing forged packets to be accepted by ntpd.CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing - CVE-2016-1551ntpd does not filter IPv4 bogon packets received from the network. This allows unauthenticated network attackers to spoof refclock packets to ntpd processes on systems that do not implement bogon filtering.CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2016-2516, CVE-2016-2517Duplicate IPs on unconfig directives will cause an assertion botch in ntpd. A regression caused by the patch for CVE-2016-2516 was fixed and identified as CVE-2016-2517.CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read - CVE-2016-2518Using a crafted packet to create a peer association with hmode > 7 causes the MATCH_ASSOC() lookup to make an out-of-bounds reference.CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - CVE-2016-2519ntpq and ntpdc can be used to store and retrieve information in ntpd. It is possible to store a data value that is larger than the size of the buffer that the ctl_getitem() function of ntpd uses to report the return value. If the length of the requested data value returned by ctl_getitem() is too large, the value NULL is returned instead. There are 2 cases where the return value from ctl_getitem() was not directly checked to make sure it's not NULL, but there are subsequent INSIST() checks that make sure the return value is not NULL. There are no data values ordinarily stored in ntpd that would exceed this buffer length. But if one has permission to store values and one stores a value that is \"too large\", then ntpd will abort if an attempt is made to read that oversized value.CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705An ntpd client that honors Kiss-of-Death (KoD) responses will honor KoD messages that have been forged by an attacker, causing it to delay or stop querying its servers for time updates. Also, an attacker can forge packets that claim to be from the target and send them to servers often enough that a server that implements KoD rate limiting will send the target machine a KoD response to attempt to reduce the rate of incoming packets, or it may also trigger a firewall block at the server for packets from the target machine. For either of these attacks to succeed, the attacker must know what servers the target is communicating with. An attacker can be anywhere on the Internet and can frequently learn the identity of the target's time source by sending the target a time query.

In some situations this may allow an attacker to conduct a timing attack to compute the value of the valid authentication digest causing forged packets to be accepted by ntpd.CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing - CVE-2016-1551ntpd does not filter IPv4 bogon packets received from the network. This allows unauthenticated network attackers to spoof refclock packets to ntpd processes on systems that do not implement bogon filtering.CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2016-2516, CVE-2016-2517Duplicate IPs on unconfig directives will cause an assertion botch in ntpd. A regression caused by the patch for CVE-2016-2516 was fixed and identified as CVE-2016-2517.CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read - CVE-2016-2518Using a crafted packet to create a peer association with hmode > 7 causes the MATCH_ASSOC() lookup to make an out-of-bounds reference.CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - CVE-2016-2519ntpq and ntpdc can be used to store and retrieve information in ntpd. It is possible to store a data value that is larger than the size of the buffer that the ctl_getitem() function of ntpd uses to report the return value. If the length of the requested data value returned by ctl_getitem() is too large, the value NULL is returned instead. There are 2 cases where the return value from ctl_getitem() was not directly checked to make sure it's not NULL, but there are subsequent INSIST() checks that make sure the return value is not NULL. There are no data values ordinarily stored in ntpd that would exceed this buffer length. But if one has permission to store values and one stores a value that is \"too large\", then ntpd will abort if an attempt is made to read that oversized value.CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705An ntpd client that honors Kiss-of-Death (KoD) responses will honor KoD messages that have been forged by an attacker, causing it to delay or stop querying its servers for time updates. Also, an attacker can forge packets that claim to be from the target and send them to servers often enough that a server that implements KoD rate limiting will send the target machine a KoD response to attempt to reduce the rate of incoming packets, or it may also trigger a firewall block at the server for packets from the target machine. For either of these attacks to succeed, the attacker must know what servers the target is communicating with. An attacker can be anywhere on the Internet and can frequently learn the identity of the target's time source by sending the target a time query. For more information on these vulnerabilities, please see NTP.org's April 2016 security advisory as well as the January 2016 security advisory.",

An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to sniff all associated wireless transmissions from the device.According to Johnson and Johnson, parent company of Animas:\"Information between the pump and meter is unencrypted, which could allow a malicious actor to capture patient treatment data, however this data does not include personally identifiable information.\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - CVE-2016-5085The Animas OneTouch insulin pump uses a CRC32 checksum as if it were an encryption key. This value then does not change between authentication handshakes between the same device and remote station. According to Animas and Rapid7, \"A malicious actor may be able to listen to communication between the pump and meter remote and obtain the necessary information to spoof being the meter remote.\"CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay - CVE-2016-5086The Animas OneTouch insulin pump uses a custom communication protocol that does not provide sufficient protections to guard against capture-replay attacks. According to Animas and Rapid7, \"Once a malicious actor has spoofed being the meter remote, he/she could learn commands a patient initiate from the meter remote to the pump and attempt to replay them from a device other than the meter remote to the pump. Please refer to the mitigation section [see Resolution below] for details on controls in place to reduce this risk.\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing - CVE-2016-5686 The Animas OneTouch insulin pump uses a custom communications protocol that does not provide sufficient protections to guard against spoofed responses. Reportedly, it may be possible for an unauthenticated remote attacker to spoof acknowledgement packets to perform actions or commands on the device, or cause a remote to believe an acknowledgement was received after performing a command.",
