        "description": "Description Adam Mariš 2016-01-06 17:51:46 UTC A flaw was discovered in the linux kernel tty subsystem which allows for disclosure of uncontrolled memory location and possible kernel panic. The information leak is caused by a race condition when attempting to set and read the tty line discipline. An attacker can use the TIOCSETD (via tty_set_ldisc ) to switch to a new line discipline, a concurrent call to with a TIOCGETD ioctl performs a read on a given tty may be able to access memory previously allocated. Up to 4 bytes may leaked when querying the line discipline.The problematic code:case TIOCGETD: return put_user(tty->ldisc->ops->num, (int __user *)p);The flaw is triggered when ldisc's address is loaded before the new address is set and the access is performed after the old is freed, which results to crash due to the kernel accessing an invalid address. If an attacker prepares the kernel slab by setting up the ldisc struct at the correct offset they can effectively read 4 bytes from any kernel memory.Invalid data at the ldisc address may also panic the machine if it is not pointing to valid mappable memory.Upstream fix:http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5c17c861a357e9458001f021a7afa7aab9937439Original proposed fix:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=1112221&action=diff"

        "description": "Description Andrej Nemec 2016-03-17 08:45:34 UTC Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to remote bufferoverflow attacks, in which crafted MPLS packets could overflow thebuffer reserved for MPLS labels in an OVS internal data structure.The MPLS packets that trigger the vulnerability and the potential forexploitation vary depending on version: - Open vSwitch 2.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable. - In Open vSwitch 2.2.x and 2.3.x, the MPLS buffer overflow can be exploited for arbitrary remote code execution. - In Open vSwitch 2.4.x, the MPLS buffer overflow does not obviously lead to a remote code execution exploit, but testing shows that it can allow a remote denial of service. - Open vSwitch 2.5.x is not vulnerable.Mitigation==========For any version of Open vSwitch, preventing MPLS packets from reachingOpen vSwitch mitigates the vulnerability. We do not recommendattempting to mitigate the vulnerability this way because of thefollowing difficulties: - Open vSwitch obtains packets before the iptables host firewall, so iptables on the Open vSwitch host cannot ordinarily block the vulnerability. - If Open vSwitch is configured to support tunnels, MPLS packets encapsulated within tunnels must also be prevented from reaching the host. - If Open vSwitch runs on a hypervisor, MPLS packets from VMs can also trigger the vulnerability.We believe that Open vSwitch 2.4 is subject to denial of service onlywhen debug logging is enabled. By default, debug logging is notenabled. Users most commonly enable debug logging at runtime usingthe \"ovs-appctl\" utility. When this is the case, the buffer overflowwill crash the ovs-vswitchd daemon once, and then when itautomatically restarts debug logging will be disabled; thus, in thissituation, the vulnerability can only cause a single, briefinterruption in service. Debug logging can also be enabledpersistently using a command-line flag; in this situation, a stream ofcrafted MPLS packets could cause an extended denial of service.Acknowledgments:Name: the Open vSwitch projectUpstream: Kashyap Thimmaraju, Bhargava Shastry"

The issue here is constructs like the following: <bean:message key=\"bunch.edit.jsp.toolbar\" arg0=\"${label}\"/>where 'label' is set based on incoming parameter values: String bunchLabel = request.getParameter(\"label\"); request.setAttribute(\"label\", bunchLabel);To avoid the XSS attack, when/wherever we do BOTH of these things, setAttribute() must be called with a StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() around the value.There are 196 instances in spacewalk we should check, to fix this kind-of problem.RE the (over)use of <input type='hidden'> with unescaped values - I have a set of changes to HiddenInputTag.java, and a sed-script that converts all of our <input type=\"hidden\"> to <rhn:hidden> instances, which enforce always using StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() on the value=.

After further investigation it was found that only [atl2] driver (code in drivers/net/ethernet/atheros/atlx/atl2.c) from the list of suspected drivers is vulnerable.As a result, certain conditions should be met to trigger the issue:- the [atl2] driver and the corresponding network card (which believed to be not so frequently used) should be present on the target system- an application should make such a sequence of calls that a network buffer for the data to be transmitted is scattered- hardware checksumming should be enabled so the packet checksum is correctThe above makes this vulnerability less probable to be hit."

        "description": "Description Kurt Seifried 2016-03-22 17:06:16 UTC Daniel P. Berrange of Red Hat reports:The spice-gtk widget (used in virt-viewer, remote-viewer, virt-managerand GNOME boxes applications) has a feature whereby it will automaticallysynchronize the local desktop client clipboard with the remote guestOS clipboard. The aforementioned applications all enable this featureunconditionally AFAICT.[virt-manager]$ git grep auto-clipboardvirtManager/viewers.py: gtk_session.set_property(\"auto-clipboard\", True)[gnome-boxes]$ git grep auto-clipboardsrc/spice-display.vala: BoxConfig.SyncProperty () { name = \"auto-clipboard\", default_value = true },src/spice-display.vala: gtk_session.bind_property (\"auto-clipboard\", toggle, \"active\",[virt-viewer]$ git grep auto-clipboardsrc/virt-viewer-session-spice.c: g_object_set(self->priv->gtk_session, \"auto-clipboard\", TRUE, NULL);The way this works is that as soon as data in the local client clipboardis updated, it is immediately transfered to the remote guest OS clipboard.This happens *regardless* of whether the remote desktop window actuallyhas keyboard focus or not. The only requirement is that the guest OS hasthe spice guest agent enabled in the QEMU config, and running in the guest.This is done by default for any recent RHEL or Fedora install, and is anoption for Windows guests too, so exposure is potentially quite broad.Now consider you have one or more SPICE sessions open to some guest OS' onyour local desktop. Now you switch to firefox to use some website thatrequires login. You are sensible so you use a program like KeepPassX tomanage passwords for all your websites. You use KeepPassX to copy thepassword for the website into the clipboard, then switch to firefox andpaste the password into firefox.At no time have you interacted with the SPICE sessions for the guest OSyou have open. Regardless though, your password has been sent to everysingle guest OS, without any indication to the user that this has happened.This is contrary to normal clipboard behaviour, where you need to give anexplicit action (eg Ctrl-V, or Menu -> Edit -> Paste) in order to give theapplication your clipboard data. As such I think users will not be expectingthis data leakge to guests.Consider for example, you are a cloud administrator and have a virt-viewersession open to one of your customers' virtual machines. Meanwile you usekeepassx and firefox to access your customer billing admin interface. Thepassword for your billing web interface has just been given away to anyapplication running in your customer's VM. Opps.How to address this is tricky, because at the same time as causing thishorrific data leakage, the auto-clipboard feature is incredibly usefuland convenient for desktop virt when you /do/ trust the guest OS you areworking with.At a very minimum, I think that the clipboard data should *only* ever betransferred to the remote guest OS, if the SPICE GTK widget actually haskeyboard focus. This would immediately remove the majority of the dataleakage risk, but that's probably not sufficient for many scenarios.So as a second step, I think all applications using spice-gtk *must*provide a way to turn off the automatic clipboard synchronization feature.Personally I'd make auto-clipboard sync an opt-in feature which you mustexplicitly enable, not enabled out of the box. Possibly we should considerwarning the user about the data leakage risk inherant in this.NB, this issue is public knowledge, because it was raised by a user onthe #virt IRC channel on irc.oftc.net. They were concerned about preciselythe scenario listed here - they did not want their passwords leaked to theirguest OS sessions.Regards,Daniel"

The vulnerability may result in RSA signature or public certificate forgery when a low public exponent (for example, e = 3) is used. Vulnerability The function rsa_verify_hash_ex (https://github.com/OPTEE/optee_os/blob/master/core/lib/libtomcrypt/src/pk/rsa/rsa_verify_hash.c) does not check the number of remaining bytes in the decrypted message after ASN.1 encoded data. The function decodes the ASN.1 message and checks that it has the correct structure and values (OID and hash). This permits additional data after the ASN.1 message that can be used to forge a PKCS1 v1.5 signature for keys with a low public exponent. The original variant of the attack is described here: https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/openpgp/current/msg00999.html----------------------------------------------------------------------"

This can potentially cause kernel heap corruption and arbitrary kernel code execution.Upstream patch:http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=147394713328707&w=2https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7bc2b55a5c030685b399bb65b6baa9ccc3d1f167https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4bd173c30792791a6daca8c64793ec0a4ae8324fDiscussion thread:http://marc.info/?t=147394719700004&r=1&w=2References:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/535"

This issue was assigned CVE-2016-7795 and is tracked via bug 1380286. Upstream bug report is:https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4234Older systemd versions either don't include the assert that is triggered in manager_invoke_notify_message(), or have manager_process_notify_fd() function return error before calling manager_invoke_notify_message(). That error return still causes systemd to exit its main loop and freeze its execution in a similar way it's done in newer versions after failed assertion.https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4234#issuecomment-250441246The manager_invoke_notify_message() function with assert was introduced in version v209:https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/5ba6985b6c8ef85a8bcfeb1b65239c863436e75b#diff-ab78220e12703ee63fa1e6a2caa16bebR1319However, the assertion was not reachable before the error return was removed in v219:https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/d875aa8ce10b458dc218c0d98f4a82c8904d6d03The systemd versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 and 7.1 are based on upstream v208, but include manager_invoke_notify_message() added via a separate backported patch. The assertion is not reachable, so those versions are affected by CVE-2016-7796, but not affected by CVE-2016-7795. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 rebased systemd to version v219. Therefore, those packages are no longer affected by CVE-2016-7796, but are now affected by CVE-2016-7795."

        "description": "Description Andrej Nemec 2016-10-25 08:25:56 UTC The curl tool's \"globbing\" feature allows a user to specify a numerical rangethrough which curl will iterate. It is typically specified as [1-5],specifying the first and the last numbers in the range. Or with [a-z], usingletters.1. The curl code for parsing the second *unsigned* number did not check for aleading minus character, which allowed a user to specify `[1--1]` with nocomplaints and have the latter `-1` number get turned into the largestunsigned long value the system can handle. This would ultimately cause curl towrite outside the dedicated malloced buffer after no less than 100,000iterations, since it would have room for 5 digits but not 6.2. When the range is specified with letters, and the ending letter is left out`[L-]`, the code would still advance its read pointer 5 bytes even if thestring was just 4 bytes and end up reading outside the given buffer.External References:https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102F.html"

The vulnerability exists since firewire supported IPv4, i.e. since version 2.6.31 (year 2009) till version v4.9-rc4. A maliciously formed fragment with a respectively large datagram_offset would cause a memcpy past the datagram buffer, which would cause a system panic or possible arbitrary code execution.The flaw requires [firewire-net] module to be loaded and is remotely exploitable from connected firewire devices, but not over a local network. In general, IP packets enclosed in the firewire frames are completely in spec. In situations when firewire and ipv4 networking is used, the systems are frequently a part of clustering sofware. They would be daisy chained from a single machine with a network connection: GATEWAY <-> HOST1 <-> HOST2 <-> HOST3 <-> HOSTN. So, the gateway could be connected to the internet, and this is how fragmented packets could get to the system. So, while arbitrary code execution is possible, the hardware configuration required for this is special and rare.Proposed patch:https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/ieee1394/linux1394.git/commit/?h=testing&id=ff89027279ec57d69797cbae7c681672f1dbea71An upstream patch and merge:https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=667121ace9dbhttps://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=03daa36f089fPublic message:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/347A research on the flaw:https://eyalitkin.wordpress.com/2016/11/06/cve-publication-cve-2016-8633/"

The vulnerability is caused by an Addition-1 integer overflow. The overflowed value is passed to function ‘malloc’ as the SIZE parameter and a buffer with zero size is allocated. Later, out-of-bound read/write can happen when accessing the buffer. Whether it’s an out-of-bound read vulnerability or out-of-bound write can be controlled by crafting the input .jb2 file.

        "description": "Description Andrej Nemec 2016-12-02 09:29:46 UTC A flaw was found in the Linux kernel networking stack in which an attacker can create crafted fragmented IPV6 packets that require reassembly. The network header offset in the reassembly process is assumed to be located in an offset prior to the fragment in memory. In some situations during fragment reassembly the header may be reconstructed in the assumed location and overwrite kernel memory with another header.The flaw involves an issue that all network headers before fragment header are pulled. Normal ipv6 reassembly will drop the skb when errors occur further down the line.The netfilter reassembly code neglects to do this correctly and instead passed the original fragment along. That was also fine back when netfilter ipv6 defrag worked with cloned fragments, as the original, pristine fragment was passed on.An attacker on the network could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.References:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/556https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/syzkaller/GFbGpX7nTEoPatch:https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg407525.html"
