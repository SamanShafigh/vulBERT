The second flaw is a \"low\" rated security issue affecting Desktop Firefox. In this attack, when a URL which is invalid for an internal protocol is pasted into the addressbar, the addressbar contents may be manipulated to show the location of an arbitrary website instead of the one currently loaded. This issue is mitigated by the protocol being prepended to the displayed URL, making the address less likely to be confused with the appended URL.

        "description": "Mozilla employee Mike Kaply reported that the Firefox session restore data can contain passwords in plain text if a password input field on a page has its type changed from \"password\" to \"text\" during a session. This can occur if the password input field has a scripted mechanism to display the password to the user. Once this type is changed, the password data will persist as clear text within stored form data for this page. This could result in a potential revelation of site passwords on sites that use this mechanism to display password data if an attacker could find a way to read the session restoration file."

This results in the buffer array holding the data being shrunk, instead of grown, resulting in attacker controlled data being written at a known offset from the newly allocated buffer. This results in a potentially exploitable crash."

In order for this vulnerability to be triggered, both the malicious HTML file as well as the shortcut must be saved to the same local directory and then loaded from there by a user."
