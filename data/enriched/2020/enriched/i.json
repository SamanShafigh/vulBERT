During this time if the underlying device is removed (a potential privilege escalation) by the user with administrator privilege, it can cause a denial of service (DoS) problem as the process wakes up to terminate and cleanup all attached files/resources. The system crashes due to the cdev structure being invalid (as already freed) which is pointed to by the inode.Refer:https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/20191125125342.6189-1-vdronov@redhat.com/T/#u"

This function validates the index and is called early on in when performing message handling. Most message handlers depend on it correctly validating the vring index. Depending on the message type the vring index is in different parts of the payload. The function contains a switch/case for each type and copies the index. This is stored in a uint16. This index is then validated. Depending on the message, the source index is an unsigned int. If integer truncation occurs (uint->uint16) the top 16 bits of the index are never validated. When they are used later on (e.g. in vhost_user_set_vring_num() or vhost_user_set_vring_addr()) it can lead to out of bound indexing.

This works at the login screen and when the screen is locked.Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):Fedora 32 LXDE x86_64authselect-1.2.1-1.fc32.x86_64.rpmHow reproducible:AlwaysSteps to Reproduce: 1. Activate \"with-pam-u2f-2fa\" (e.g. execute \"authselect select sssd with-pam-u2f-2fa without-nullok\" by root) 2. Activate a Yubikey for a user (e.g. exectute \"mkdir ~/.config/Yubico; pamu2fcfg > ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys\" by the user and press the Yubikey button) 3. Reboot the system 4. Wait until the login manager appears 5. Press the key combination Strg-Alt-F2 to switch to a console 6. Login as the user only with the password without the YubikeyActual results:Login without Yubikey is possible.Expected results:The login should not be possible without verification of the Yubikey or should never be possible on the console.Additional info:This is a potential security problem because someone might choose a weak password, e.g. a pin of four digits, because of the second factor (which would be ok if the 2FA would realy work). But because the 2FA can be avoided that would be highly insecure.Workaround:Remove the option \"nouserok\" in the files \"/etc/pam.d/*\". But that should only be done when login by a Yubikey is already activated for root (otherwise root cannot login anymore)."

It was reported by SUSE Security as follows:The host application (tested with `remote-viewer` from the virt-viewer package) chooses an incrementally growing `task_id` for file exchangeswhich starts counting at 1. Thus the `task_id` is predictable. Since any unauthenticated local client can replace the mapping of `task_id` to clientconnection by its own client connection, there is a possibility for an attacker to obtain parts of the transferred file data.File data from the host system can end up in full or in parts in the client connection of an illegitimate local user in the VM system. Exploitability will be difficult if there is not a suitable side channel with information about file transfers going on.

        "description": "Description Mauro Matteo Cascella 2020-10-08 10:12:40 UTC The following flaw was reported by SUSE Security:One major security property of `spice-vdagentd` is that it only allows those clients access to most of the SPICE features (like clipboard, file transfer) that are currently in an active session according to systemd. It is possible for arbitrary local users (like *nobody*) to connect to`spice-vdagentd` but these connections should not be able to interact with the host machine, because they don't belong to the active session.There is a race condition between the point in time when a client performs the `connect()` call to establish a connection with `spice-vdagentd` and the time `spice-vdagentd` retrieves and checks the PID in its `agent_connect()` function. The described race condition is very hard to hit under normal circumstances, because the `agent_connect()` function in `spice-vdagentd` is very likely to run before an unrelated process gets reassigned the malicious PID in question. When combined with the file descriptor exhaustion security issue however, then this attack will become way more feasible.An unprivileged local attacker inside a VM could use this flaw to become the \"active agent\" for `spice-vdagentd` for the graphical session of a legitimate local user. If successful then the attacker can access the host's clipboard contents or send malicious clipboard content to the host. The attacker can also retrieve file data from the host or send invalid screen resolution and display information to the host. If the victim's graphical session already runs a legitimate `spice-vdagent` then a successful attack will trigger an information leak protection logic in `vdagentd.c:874`. This has the effect of a denial-of-service, because neither the attacker nor the legitimate user will be able to use the SPICE features anymore."

These spaces are supposed to be ignored, but invalid DNs strings with spaces may instead cause a zero byte tobe written into out-of-bounds memory.An LDAP bind request can send a string DN as a username. This DN is necessarily parsed before the password is checked, so an attacker without real credentials can anonymously trigger this bug.The location of zero byte is a negative offset relative to the location of a dynamically allocated heap buffer; the exact offset depends on the DN string. While it is possible for an attacker to cause non-fatal data corruption, usefully targeting this is likely to be difficult and the most likely outcome is a crash.The affected parsing routine is widely used. LDAP bind is not the only way to trigger the bug remotely, though it appears to be the only unauthenticated method."
