It is designed to protect a system against malicious code being loaded and executed early in the boot process, before the operating system has been loaded. SB works using cryptographic checksums and signatures. Each program that is loaded by the firmware includes a signature and a checksum, and before allowing execution the firmware will verify that the program is trusted by validating the checksum and the signature. When SB is enabled on a system, any attempt to execute an untrusted program will not be allowed. This stops unexpected / unauthorised code from running in the UEFI environment. Most x86 hardware comes from the factory pre-loaded with Microsoft keys. This means the firmware on these systems will trust binaries that are signed by Microsoft. Most modern systems will ship with SB enabled - they will not run any unsigned code by default, but it is possible to change the firmware configuration to either disable SB or to enrol extra signing keys. Debian, like many other Linux-based operating systems, uses a program called shim to extend that trust from the firmware to the other programs that we need to be secured during early boot: the GRUB2 bootloader, the Linux kernel and firmware update tools (fwupd and fwupdate)."
