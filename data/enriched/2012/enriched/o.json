One known symptom is an unexploitable crash in handling OCSP responses. NSS also mishandles zero-length basic constraints, assuming default values for some types that should be rejected as malformed. These issues have been addressed in NSS 3.13.4, which is now being used by Mozilla."

        "description": "Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a series critically rated of use-after-free and buffer overflow issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting five additional use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow flaws introduced during Firefox development that were fixed before general release. In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products."

        "title": "Improper security filtering for cross-origin wrappers",
        "description": "Mozilla developer Bobby Holley reported that security wrappers filter at the time of property access, but once a function is returned, the caller can use this function without further security checks. This affects cross-origin wrappers, allowing for write actions on objects when only read actions should be properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products."
