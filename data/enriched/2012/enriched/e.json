Using a carefully crafted database name, analready authenticated MySQL user could make the server crash or even executearbitrary code as the mysql system user.For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version5.1.66-0+squeeze1.For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), thisproblem will be fixed soon.We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.1 packages."
