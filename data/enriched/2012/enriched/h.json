The protections to protect unprivileged users from writing to process memory were found to be insufficient and have resulted in exploitation of the interface.

        "overview": "Some 64-bit operating systems and virtualization software running on Intel CPU hardware are vulnerable to a local privilege escalation attack. The vulnerability may be exploited for local privilege escalation or a guest-to-host virtual machine escape.Intel claims that this vulnerability is a software implementation issue, as their processors are functioning as per their documented specifications. However, software that fails to take the Intel-specific SYSRET behavior into account may be vulnerable.",
        "description": "A ring3 attacker may be able to specifically craft a stack frame to be executed by ring0 (kernel) after a general protection exception (#GP). The fault will be handled before the stack switch, which means the exception handler will be run at ring0 with an attacker's chosen RSP causing a privilege escalation.Details from XenCVE-2012-0217 / XSA-7 - 64-bit PV guest privilege escalation vulnerabilityA vulnerability which can allow a 64-bit PV guest kernel running on a 64-bit hypervisor to escalate privileges to that of the host by arranging for a system call to return via sysret to a non-canonical RIP. Intel CPUs deliver the resulting exception in an undesirable processor state.Details from FreeBSDFreeBSD-SA-12:04.sysret: Privilege escalation when returning from kernelFreeBSD/amd64 runs on CPUs from different vendors. Due to varying behaviour of CPUs in 64 bit mode a sanity check of the kernel may be insufficient when returning from a system call. Successful exploitation of the problem can lead to local kernel privilege escalation, kernel data corruption and/or crash.Details from MicrosoftUser Mode Scheduler Memory Corruption Vulnerability - MS12-042 - ImportantAn elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows User Mode Scheduler handles system requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.Mitigating Factors for User Mode Scheduler Memory Corruption VulnerabilityMitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.This vulnerability only affects Intel x64-based versions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.Systems with AMD or ARM-based CPUs are not affected by this vulnerability.Details from Red HatRHSA-2012:0720-1 & RHSA-2012:0721-1: It was found that the Xen hypervisor implementation as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 did not properly restrict the syscall return addresses in the sysret return path to canonical addresses. An unprivileged user in a 64-bit para-virtualized guest, that is running on a 64-bit host that has an Intel CPU, could use this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges, allowing them to execute arbitrary code at the hypervisor level.

A received packet, which has actually less bytes, than it is declared in its header, causes a buffer overflow, which immediately leads to a crash of OSPF protocol process and subsequent disruption of IPv4 routing.Like many other OSPF cases, exploiting this vulnerability requires an ability to form an OSPF adjacency with the attacked OSPF router and initiate a database exchange process with it. Usual OSPF security precautions (including MD5 authentication) may lower the risk of such event. Upgrading to a patched version of Quagga is recommended regardless of any other measures taken.CVE-2012-0250: Error in OSPF parsing Network-LSA messages Can Cause a Crash of Quagga ospfdThe ospfd implementation of OSPF in Quagga allows a remote attacker (on a local network segment with OSPF enabled) to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) with a malformed OSPF Network-LSA message.Program Impacted: Quagga (ospfd)Description:OSPFv2 implementation in Quagga version 0.99.20 and before does not perform a proper length check of the Network-LSA structures contained in an LS-Update OSPF packet. When an otherwise correct LS-Update OSPF packet contains a Network-LSA structure, which has its \"Length\" header field set to value bigger than the actual number of bytes in the buffer, a buffer overflow happens.

When an OPEN with a malformed AS4 capability message is detected, the code fails to flush the message buffers for the peer. When the peer next connects and sends a message, the code will attempt to parse the stale, half-consumed data in the message buffer as it were a fresh BGP message. This leads to an assert and exit of the BGP daemon in the BGP OPEN message parsing code.The vulnerability is not restricted to BGP neighbors with 4-byte AS but can only be done from any configured peers (or sources spoofing the IP of a configured peer).

When a Bloxx administrator views reports in the administrative interface that contains the entry, the malicious code will execute. A malicious user could use this to gain administrative access to the Bloxx administrator interface or execute arbitrary code on an administrative user.Example : http://localhost/?test=<script>alert(\"XSS\");</script>(2) The following menu functions in the Bloxx administrative interface are reported to be vulnerable to Persistent XSS. A malicious lower level administrator that has access to one of these functions could inject malicious code targeting a higher level administrator to escalate privileges or execute arbitrary code. Reported menu functions affected: Administrators -> Administrators: Full Name fieldFiltering & Protection -> Categories: Name and Description fieldsIdentification -> Identify: Name fieldUsers & Groups -> Users: Username fieldUsers & Groups -> Groups: Name and Description fieldsFiltering Policies: Name and Description fieldsProxy & Cache -> Redirection: Original URL and Redirection fieldsAdministrators -> Audit Trail: XSS that is injected in the Redirection function will render here and executeAlerts -> Email: Destination fieldAppliance Customization -> Access Denied Page: Name fieldAppliance Customization -> Login Page: Name fieldAppliance Customization -> Logout Denied Page: Name fieldCWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) CVE-2012-2564:(3) It has been reported that all the functions on the Bloxx administrative interface are vulnerable to CSRF. A malicious user could craft a specialized web page and force a Bloxx administrator to execute unwanted actions on the Bloxx administrative interface in which they are currently authenticated. It is not required that the Bloxx administrator have a window open to the administrative interface. If the Bloxx administrator did not use the \"Log out\" link, even closing the browser window could still leave the session open.(4) The Bloxx Web Filtering device uses Microdasys for SSL interception. When a user tries to use HTTPS to connect to a site that does not support HTTPS, a Microdasys SSL error page is displayed to the user. This error page is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack. A malicious user can send a crafted HTTPS URL for a site that does not support HTTPS that contains malicious code to a victim. When the victim tries to connect to the crafted URL, the Microdasys engine will try to connect over HTTPS to the URL. The connection will fail since the target site does not support HTTPS and the Microdasys SSL error page will be presented to the user which includes the unsanitized URL.Example: https://www.website.com/test.php?test=\"><script>alert(\"XSS\");</script>CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format CVE-2012-2565:(5) The Bloxx administrative interface has a function to backup the current configuration and save it to a file. The file that is saved includes all the configuration information of the Bloxx device including the administrator user credentials. The user information includes the username, administrative level, email address, and a SHA-1 hash of the password. If a malicious lower level administrator has access to the backup functionality or a malicious user has access to the backup file, they could extract the SHA-1 hashes to be cracked. No salt is implemented so the hashes can be cracked against a rainbow table. If a malicious lower level administrator also has rights to restore a backup file, they could replace the password of a higher level administrator account with a hash with their own.CWE-644: Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax CVE-2012-2566:(6) An unauthenticated user can bypass the IP restriction and falsify the logs for HTTPS sites by inserting the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header with the value of an authorized IP address. A malicious user could also connect via HTTPS to a site that does not support HTTPS with the X-Forwarded-For header and the entry in the Bloxx logs will record it as a connection to a HTTP site. For example, a malicious user could direct requests to non-approved websites, such as https://www.website.com, and the Bloxx logs will reflect that the victim has visited http://www.website.com and other adult websites.The CVSS score below applies to CVE-2012-2564.",

This can be mitigated by adding \"X-Frame-Options\" => \"DENY\" to the response headers.

See https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ClickjackingCWE-384: Session Fixation CVE-2012-4937: Pattern Insight: Insecure session management leading to privilege escalationPattern Insight session management is insecure, making privilege escalation and authentication bypass possible. When a user logs into Pattern Insight, the user's browser either has or does not have a jsession_id session cookie associated with the Pattern Insight domain. If the user does not have a session cookie associated with the Pattern Insight domain, the server provides the user a jsession_id and associates that session id with the user's current session. If the user already has a session cookie associated with the Pattern Insight domain, the server checks the \"validity\" of the session cookie. If the cookie is of \"valid\" form, the server associates the provided jsession_id session cookie with user's new session.Attack scenario:1. Attacker obtains a \"valid\" session key.2. Attacker sets victim's jsession_id session cookie with the \"valid\" session key in step 13.

The Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device Admin Authority Authentication bypass (HWNSIRT-2012-1029) CVE-2012-5968:Huawei E585 pocket wifi 2 device fails to check the login status of admin sessions, which leads to an attacker being able to bypass the admin authority authentication allowing them access to the protected files and configure the device. This can lead to the leak and tampering of the non-shared user data and the disclosure of the session ID, allowing the attacker to configure the devices by authentication with the session ID which can be obtained by the attacker. The vendor has stated this vulnerability can only be exploited on the LAN side, and it cannot be exploited to launch attacks on the WAN side.2.
