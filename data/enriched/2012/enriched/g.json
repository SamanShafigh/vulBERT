If a user were tricked into opening amalicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker couldexploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.(CVE-2012-3984)Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow theHTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were trickedinto opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remoteattacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacksvia JavaScript execution. (CVE-2012-3985)Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly performsecurity checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. (CVE-2012-3986)Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could bebypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a speciallycrafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker couldexploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.(CVE-2012-3991)Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a userwere tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, aremote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to injectscript or intercept posted data. (CVE-2012-3992)Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird thatallowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked intoviewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remoteattacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidentialdata, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-3993, CVE-2012-3994, CVE-2012-4184)Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws inThunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were trickedinto opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attackercould exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the contextof another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking theprogram.
