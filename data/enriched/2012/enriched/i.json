        "description": "Description Vincent Danen 2012-01-11 21:22:38 UTC A flaw was found in the way that curl sanitized URLs. The upstream advisory [1] reports: libcurl is vulnerable to a data injection attack for certain protocols through control characters embedded or percent-encoded in URLs. When parsing URLs, libcurl's parser is very laxed and liberal and only parses as little as possible and lets as much as possible through as long as it can figure out what to do. In the specific process when libcurl extracts the file path part from a given URL, it didn't always verify the data or escape control characters properly before it passed the file path on to the protocol-specific code that then would use it for its protocol business. This passing through of control characters could be exploited by someone who would be able to pass in a handicrafted URL to libcurl. Lots of libcurl using applications let users enter URLs in one form or another and not all of these check the input carefully to prevent malicious ones. A malicious user might pass in %0d%0a to get treated as CR LF by libcurl, and by using this fact a user can trick for example a POP3 client to delete a message instead of getting it or trick an SMTP server to send an unintended message. This vulnerability can be used to fool libcurl with the following protocols: IMAP, POP3 and SMTP. There is no known exploit for this problem.This flaw only affects curl versions 7.20.0 up to and including 7.23.1 It is corrected in 7.24.0 by scanning for a range of \"bad codes\" in the path part of URLs so that they are rejected before any protocol code even can consider using them.This flaw has been assigned the name CVE-2012-0036.[1] http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.htmlStatement:Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of curl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 or 6."

Depending on the particular guest kernel it is also possible that non-privileged guest users could also elevate their privileges to that of the host.For Red Hat Enterprise Linux guests, only privileged guest users can exploit this issue. HVM guests and 32-bit PV guests cannot be used to exploit this issue.Acknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Rafal Wojtczuk as the original reporter."

However further investigation into thevulnerability revealed that it can only be triggered if the adminhas not only activated transparent cookie encryption, but alsoexplicitly disabled several other security features of Suhosin.In addition to that remote exploitation requires a PHP applicationthat puts unfiltered user input into a call to the header()function that sends a Set-Cookie header.Furthermore most modern unix systems compile the Suhosin extensionwith the FORTIFY_SOURCE flag, which will detect the possible bufferoverflow and abort execution before something bad can happen.This can only ne done with the feature is enabled (suhosin.cookie.encrypt).

Reporters were able to find colliding strings efficiently using meet in the middle attack.As various web application frameworks for Python automatically pre-fill certain dictionaries with data from the HTTP request (such as GET or POST parameters) for Python web application, a remote attacker could use this flaw to make Python interpreter use excessive amount of CPU time by sending a POST request with large amount of parameters which hash to the same value.This problem is similar to the issue that was previously reported for and fixed in e.g. perl: http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf"

If the ignoreBaseDecision property is set to true on JBossWebRealm, the web authorization process is handled exclusively by JBossAuthorizationEngine, without any input from JBoss Web.

Unfortunately,SendErrToClient() expects a pointer, but was being passed the raw maskvalue, causing it to use the mask as a pointer, either segfaulting (if thathappened to be an invalid pointer), or returning whatever data happened tobe accessible in the 4 bytes at the address specified by the mask value.X11R6 through X11R6.6 appear to be vulnerable. The fix shown below wasintroduced by XFree86 in their 3.3.3 release as part of the commit for: Prototype/ansification cleanup for Xserver/XIE, xfs, fontlib, mkfontdir, and fix some bugs found along the way (#2103, Thomas Dickey).X11R6.7 incorporated the XFree86 changes, and thus X11R6.7 and later releasesfrom X.Org are not vulnerable.[1] http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2012-July/002040.htmlStatement:Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of xorg-x11-xfs as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. It does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as it no longer uses or provides the XFS font server."

The fix is not perfect because:1) Theoretically, a standard-conforming C compiler could generate code that is still vulnerable to division by zero, but I was not aware of any compilers doing that.2) Logically, we should have groups_per_flex = 2^s_log_groups_per_flex, and the fix doesn't really ensure that.

The problem is that when a memory slot is destroyed the pages for the associated memory slot are neither unpinned nor unmapped from the iommu.The problem is that those pages are now never unpinned and continue to have an increased reference count.

The code will work only on kernels 2.6.32 and above since it uses the new \"anonymous mapping\" API for getting huge pages. Similar reproduction is possible when using the shmem API or the hugetlbfs API. Stock kernel might not crash, debug kernel will detect the corruption and kill the process.Steps to Reproduce:1. Untar the attached file2. Run run_test.sh. The fuse-devel package and sudo rights are required for the fuse mount. Sudo rights are also required for enabling huge pages.3. Observe the kernel crash when running debug kernel. Normal kernels will (usually) not crash, as the slab allocator will not return the memory blocks to the system general pool for a while.Actual results:A general protection fault message is printed, and the server is frozen.Expected results:The process should exit without the kernel crashing.Additional info:Verified on RHEL 6.0 with Dell PowerEdge 2950, should exist also on RHEL 6.2 and 6.1.Upstream commit:http://git.kernel.org/linus/90481622d75715bfcb68501280a917dbfe516029Acknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank Shachar Raindel for reporting this issue."

This could lead to exposure of stale disk data via the produced metadump image.The expectation of xfs_metadump is to obfuscate all but the shortest names in the metadata, as noted in the manpage:By default, xfs_metadump obfuscates most file (regular file, directory andsymbolic link) names and extended attribute names to allow the dumps tobe sent without revealing confidential information. Extended attribute valuesare zeroed and no data is copied. The only exceptions are file or attributenames that are 4 or less characters in length. Also file names that spanextents (this can only occur with the mkfs.xfs(8) options where -n size > -bsize) are not obfuscated. Names between 5 and 8 characters in lengthinclusively are partially obfuscated.While the xfs_metadump tool can be run by unprivileged users, it requires appropriate permissions to access block devices (such as root) where the sensitive data might be dumped.

This patch removes all but the MII ioctls, renumbers them to use the standard ones, and adds the proper permission check for SIOCSMIIREG. We can also get rid of the dl2k-specific struct mii_data in favor of the generic struct mii_ioctl_data. Since we have the phyid on hand, we can add the SIOCGMIIPHY ioctl too. Most of the MII code for the driver could probably be converted to use the generic MII library but I don't have a device to test the results.Upstream commit:http://git.kernel.org/linus/1bb57e940e1958e40d51f2078f50c3a96a9b2d75Acknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank Stephan Mueller for reporting this issue."

After subtracting the number of padding bytes from the record length value, it did not check the resulting record length before subtracting the size of explicit IV (initialization vector for CBC encryption modes). This could result in an integer underflow of the record length value, leading to a buffer over-read and out-of-bounds access. A remote TLS peer could use this to crash an application using OpenSSL (usually a TLS or DTLS server) by sending a specially TLS packet.Explicit IV is used in TLS 1.2, 1.1 and DTLS. The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, and 6 only support TLS 1.0 and do not support TLS 1.1 and 1.2 and hence are not affected by the TLS part of this problem. TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2 support was introduced upstream in OpenSSL version 1.0.1. That version is currently only available in Fedora Rawhide/18.The support for DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) is enabled in openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 and those versions are affected by the DTLS part of this problem.

An example of such application is web application server (such as tomcat, see bug #750521) that may fill hash tables with data from HTTP request (such as GET or POST parameters).

Parts of this also apply to the 32-bit variant, but it is probably best to remove the code duplication and use the 64 bit variant everywhere.The value of numpid is not validated against the overall PDU size. Processing a crafted PDU could read past the end of the PDU, crashing the process or disclosing information.The embedded numval counts are not checked, either, with similar results.In the valfmt != PM_VAL_INSITU case, the extracted pointer may point outside the area which holds such values. This can result in crashes or information disclosure. The length field inside the value is not validated against the PDU size. Values can overlap with each other or with other parts of the PDU, but this might not be a problem.The nvsize/vbsize calculations can overflow. This will be fixed implicitly when the contributing values are checked against the PDU size.On 32-bit architectures, the malloc size calculation overflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.

However on further investigation of ImageMagick Tom Lane found that PNG malloc function (Magick_png_malloc) in turn calls AcquireMagickMemory with an improper size argument:#ifdef PNG_USER_MEM_SUPPORTEDstatic png_voidp Magick_png_malloc(png_structp png_ptr,png_uint_32 size){ (void) png_ptr; return((png_voidp) AcquireMagickMemory((size_t) size));}Similar code is present in GraphicsMagick:#ifdef PNG_USER_MEM_SUPPORTEDstatic png_voidp png_IM_malloc(png_structp png_ptr,png_uint_32 size){ (void) png_ptr; return MagickAllocateMemory(png_voidp,(size_t) size);}This is incorrect, the size argument should be declared png_alloc_size_t according to 1.5, or png_size_t according to 1.2.\"As this function stands, it invisibly does the wrong thing for any request over 4GB.

With the default parameters, when python-crypto is used, it will use ECB cipher mode, and any two 16-byte-aligned plaintext blocks with the same contents will be encrypted into the same ciphertext blocks at the corresponding positions. An attacker able to guess the structure of a part of the session data, and influence contents of some data, could use this to check whether other parts of the session have a specific value.When python-beaker uses other encryption backends, such as pycryptopp, it uses the CTR cipher mode rather than ECB, which does not have this vulnerability.In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, python-beaker does not support or use python-crypto, and is not vulnerable to this flaw.In current Fedora releases, python-beaker can use both backends, but prefers pycryptopp (and the package Requires it), and is not vulnerable to this flaw.Statement:Not vulnerable.

The ads contains a lot of already-public information for users with READ privileges, however it also provides the ClaimId (as opposed to the PublicClaimId which truncates the full value of the ClaimID). If an attacker could obtain the private ClaimId, they could use it to control the running job, and also start new jobs on the system."

X.org does not sanitize the environment when starting, which means it will be aware of, and pass along, environment variables. When X.org is using the DBus backend, specifically versions 1.5.x or newer, the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is passed along to libdbus. The DBUS system address can take a unixexec (Executed Subprocess on UNIX) transport [1] which allows one to specify a binary to execute and arguments to pass to it.Because the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is not scrubbed by X, this environment variable is passed along to libdbus, and it specifies the address of the system message bus. A malicious local user could use this, in conjunction with the unixexec transport, to execute arbitrary code as root (because /usr/bin/Xorg is suid root).[1] http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#transports-execAcknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for reporting this issue."

JSON is safer. However, note that it supports serialization for only some specific subset of object types; this should be enough for what we need, though. To avoid issues on upgrades (unability to read pickled values, and cache poisoning for old servers not understanding JSON), we add a memcache_serialization_support configuration option, with the following values: 0 = older, insecure pickle serialization 1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure) 2 = json serialization only (secure and the default) To avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should upgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24 hours) set to 2 and reload. Support for 0 and 1 will be removed in future versions. Part of bug 1006414. Change-Id: Id7d6d547b103b4f23ebf5be98b88f09ec6027ce4"

These are not temporary files and are rather used for locking purposes. They are created in a way that allows symlink attacks.As files are opened RDWR, and not written to, they don't seem to allow file corruption as typical symlink attacks do. It is still possible to create new files at arbitrary locations (e.g. /etc/nologin) or make arbitrary file world writable (e.g. /etc/shadow) with the privileges of the user running pkcsslotd or an application using opencrpytoki library.

Instead, there is an assert after the operation which fails on out-of-bounds access.If asserts are enabled, this results in a pre-authentication denial-of-service vulnerability. Red Hat builds disable asserts, so they are not affected by this vulnerability. Examining the protocol decoders showed that the read overrun is limited to very few bytes because all the large types perform proper length checking (so it seems impossible that an unmapped page can be reached and cause a crash). Regarding write overruns, there is a check of the buffer size against the encoded size (which is conceptually not possible for the read case), so there should not be any write buffer overrun, assuming that the encoded size account is completely correct.The suggestion is to remove the asserts from putOctet/getOctet etc. and replace them with bounds checks which throw exceptions on failure.Acknowledgements:This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team."

A malicious host hosting proxy.pac, or a man in the middle attacker, could use this flaw to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow in an application using libproxy, if proxy configuration instructed it to download proxy.pac file from a remote HTTP server.url::get_pac() uses a fixed size buffer buffer[] to store content of the proxy.pac file downloaded from a remote server. When filling the buffer, it uses server-supplied content length value, rather than size buffer, as a limit for the size of the input copied into the buffer.

Due to the way pam_ssh_agent_auth was built in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora packages, this led to glibc's error() function being called instead of the error() function from OpenSSH sources that was meant to be used. As the two error functions expect different arguments, this could cause an application configured to use the pam_ssh_agent_auth module (typically su or sudo) to crash, disclose portion of its memory, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.This issue did not affect upstream versions of pam_ssh_agent_auth and was specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux / Fedora packages, where pam_ssh_agent_auth is part of the openssh source RPM. This bundling is used to avoid duplicating OpenSSH source code. pam_ssh_agent_auth embeds a copy of the OpenSSH code.

Certain errors may also be preventedby never directly importing a key, but first just \"looking\" at the key(eg: \"gpg bad_key.pkr\"). However, this is not guaranteed to work in all cases;though upgrading to 1.4.13 does work for the issues reported.]Discovery:The problem was discovered during a byte-fuzzing test of OpenPGPcertificates for an unrelated application. Each byte in turn wasreplaced by a random byte, and the modified certificate fed to theapplication to check that it handled errors correctly. Gpg was used asa control, but it itself turned out to have errors related to packetparsing. The errors are generally triggered when fuzzing the lengthfield of OpenPGP packets, which cascades into subsequent errors incertain situations.External references:https://bugs.g10code.com/gnupg/issue1455http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=gnupg.git;a=commitdiff;h=f0b33b6fb8e0586e9584a7a409dcc31263776a67"

In such a configuration, rather then failing and not permitting authentication which is what would be expected, pam_winbind will allow authentication to proceed.For instance, if the following is specified and the user is not a member of the group 'Admin', they will not obtain access to the system:auth sufficient pam_winbind.so use_first_pass require_membership_of=AdminOn the other hand, if the non-existent group 'AdminOops' is specified, the user is obviously not a member of said group, authentication will be permitted:auth sufficient pam_winbind.so use_first_pass require_membership_of=AdminOopsThe commit [2] that most likely introduced this flaw indicates that this was introduced October 2009 and another commit [3] looks like the fix, although that is for another bug [4] that's somewhat related to this issue and somewhat not.[1] https://lists.samba.org/archive/samba-technical/2012-June/084593.html[2] http://git.samba.org/?p=samba.git;a=commit;h=31f1a36901b5b8959dc51401c09c114829b50392[3] http://git.samba.org/?p=samba.git;a=commitdiff;h=f62683956a3b182f6a61cc7a2b4ada2e74cde243[4] https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8598"

When the subagent is under heavy load, requests start to pile up in the queue, replies from the subagent arrive too late (per log messages) and eventually the subagent is timed out. When the timeout occurs there is a high probability of either a crash (Segfault) or a hang (100% CPU utilisation, tight loop in the snmpd code) dependent on the version of the snmpd under test. This also happens when the subagent dies unexpectedly with outstanding transactions unserviced.References:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q4/398http://sourceforge.net/p/net-snmp/bugs/2411/Patch:http://sourceforge.net/p/net-snmp/patches/1237/?page=0"

By default it loads files it understands in a large number of standard system locations (/etc, /boot), but can also open files in a user specified location [1],[2].It has two save modes of interest, \"backup\" that keeps the original in PATH.augorig and \"newfile\" that leaves the file alone, but writes the edited version to PATH.augnew. These can be set via the API [3] or --backup/--new with augtool (CLI tool around the API).A flaw was found in the current 0.10.0 version and most previous versions. It requires that the directory containing the file to be edited is writable by another user, so this needs the user to explicitly open a file in another location or for a file in a default location to be in a group/world writable directory.Augeas always opens PATH.augnew for writing, sets the file modes identically to PATH, writes the file contents and then renames PATH.augnew to PATH.Creation of a symlink at PATH.augnew will cause the new file contents to be written to the symlink target and then the symlink is moved to PATH. This enables an attacker to get to the file contents in the symlink target and also subvert PATH.The code's at src/transform.c in transform_save [4].[1] http://augeas.net/page/Loading_specific_files[2] https://github.com/raphink/augeas-sandbox/blob/master/augload[3] http://augeas.net/docs/api.html#saving-the-tree[4] https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/augeas.git/tree/src/transform.c?id=547442f#n885"
