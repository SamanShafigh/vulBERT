Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0075 A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer accesses an object that has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see CVE-2009-0075. Mitigating Factors for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0075 Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.This vulnerability affects Windows Internet Explorer 7 only. It does not affect supported versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 6. Workarounds for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0075 Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality: Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zonesYou can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.Impact of workaround. There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in \"Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone\".Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneAfter you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.To do this, follow these steps:In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are *.windowsupdate.microsoft.com and *.update.microsoft.com. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zoneYou can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.Click the Security tab.Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.Note Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.Impact of workaround. There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting.

Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0. The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0075 A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer accesses an object that has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see CVE-2009-0075. Mitigating Factors for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0075 Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.This vulnerability affects Windows Internet Explorer 7 only. It does not affect supported versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 6. Workarounds for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0075 Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality: Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zonesYou can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.Impact of workaround. There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in \"Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone\".Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneAfter you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.To do this, follow these steps:In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are *.windowsupdate.microsoft.com and *.update.microsoft.com. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zoneYou can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.Click the Security tab.Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.Note Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly.

Security updates are available from Microsoft Update, Windows Update, and Office Update. Security updates are also available at the Microsoft Download Center. You can find them most easily by doing a keyword search for \"security update.\" Finally, security updates can be downloaded from the Microsoft Update Catalog. The Microsoft Update Catalog provides a searchable catalog of content made available through Windows Update and Microsoft Update, including security updates, drivers and service packs. By searching using the security bulletin number (such as, “MS08-010”), you can add all of the applicable updates to your basket (including different languages for an update), and download to the folder of your choosing. For more information about the Microsoft Update Catalog, see the Microsoft Update Catalog FAQ. Detection and Deployment Guidance Microsoft has provided detection and deployment guidance for this month’s security updates. This guidance will also help IT professionals understand how they can use various tools to help deploy the security update, such as Windows Update, Microsoft Update, Office Update, the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), the Office Detection Tool, Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), and the Extended Security Update Inventory Tool. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723.

Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0. The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

Deployment Information Installing the Update When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994. For more information about the installer, visit the Microsoft TechNet Web site. For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684. This security update supports the following setup switches.

Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A remote code execution vulnerability exists in implementations of Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) on the Internet Authentication Service. The vulnerability is due to incorrect copying into memory of messages received by the server when handling PEAP authentication attempts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2505](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-2505). #### Mitigating Factors for Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505 Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: - Servers using Internet Authentication Service are only affected when configured to use PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 authentication. #### Workarounds for Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505 Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality: - **Use an authentication protocol other than PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 on your Internet Authentication Service server** **Impact of workaround.** Changing authentication protocols may require reconfiguration of clients. #### FAQ for Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505 **What is the scope of the vulnerability?** This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. **What causes the vulnerability?** This vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the PEAP authentication requests. This could lead to an error while copying specific memory structures when the IAS server deals with PEAP authentication attempts. **What is the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)?** Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) is a member of the family of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) protocols. PEAP uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create an encrypted channel between an authenticating PEAP client, such as a mobile computer communicating over a wireless network, and a PEAP authenticator, such as an Internet Authentication Service (IAS) or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server. PEAP does not specify an authentication method, but provides additional security for other EAP authentication protocols, such as EAP-MS-CHAP v2, that can operate through the TLS encrypted channel provided by PEAP. PEAP is used as an authentication method for 802.1X wireless client computers, but is not supported for virtual private network (VPN) or other remote access clients. **What is the Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAP v2)?** MS-CHAP uses a challenge-response mechanism to authenticate connections without sending any passwords. MS-CHAP v2 provides mutual authentication, the generation of stronger initial data encryption keys for Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE), and different encryption keys for sent and received data. To minimize the risk of password compromise during a password change, support for older methods of the MS-CHAP password change is not included. MS-CHAP v2 is a mutual authentication protocol, which means that both the client and the server prove that they have knowledge of the user's password. First, the remote access server asks the remote access client for proof by sending a challenge to the client. Then the remote access client asks the remote access server for proof by sending a challenge back to the server. If the server cannot prove that it has knowledge of the user's password by correctly answering the challenge from the client, the client terminates the connection. Without mutual authentication, a remote access client cannot establish a connection to an unauthorized remote access server. **What are Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server?** In Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Internet Authentication Service (IAS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server. As a RADIUS server, IAS performs centralized connection authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of network access, including wireless and virtual private network (VPN) connections. On Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, IAS does not support RADIUS Proxy because it is based on the Option Pack version. In Windows Server 2003, Internet Authentication Service (IAS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy. As a RADIUS server, IAS performs centralized connection authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of network access, including wireless and virtual private network (VPN) connections. As a RADIUS proxy, IAS forwards authentication and accounting messages to other RADIUS servers. Network Policy Server (NPS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy in Windows Server 2008. NPS is the replacement for Internet Authentication Service (IAS) in Windows Server 2003. Both Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server expose the PEAP MS-CHAP v2 code that is affected by this vulnerability. **Why is the severity of the vulnerability Important on Windows operating system clients?** Windows operating system clients contain the vulnerable MS-CHAP v2 code, but none of the components included as part of the operating systems use this code in a way that may expose the vulnerability. Theoretically, a third-party application that supports authentication using MS-CHAP v2 could render a system vulnerable. As clients are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario. However, Microsoft is providing an update as part of this security bulletin that addresses the root cause on client platforms. **Why is the severity of the vulnerability Important on Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems?** Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems does not allow installation of the Internet Authentication Service. However, the vulnerable binaries are present on the machine. Theoretically, a third-party application that supports authentication using MS-CHAP v2 could render a system vulnerable. As these servers are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario. However, Microsoft is providing an update as part of this security bulletin that addresses the root cause on Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems. **What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?** An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with administrator privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts. **How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an incorrectly formed PEAP authentication request to an IAS server. **What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?** Internet Authentication Services servers that allow remote, untrusted users to authenticate are at particular risk from this vulnerability. **What does the update do?** The update changes IAS to correctly validate MS-CHAP v2 authentication requests. **When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?** No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. **When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?** No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued. MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677 ----------------------------------------------------------- An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Internet Authentication Service. An attacker could send a specially crafted Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAP v2) authentication request that could obtain access to network resources under the privileges of a specific, authorized user. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-3677](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-3677). #### Mitigating Factors for MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677 Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: - Servers using Internet Authentication Service are only affected when configured to use PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 authentication. #### Workarounds for MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass in Internet Authentication Service Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677 Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality: - **Use an authentication protocol other than PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 on your Internet Authentication Service server** **Impact of workaround.** Changing authentication protocols may require reconfiguration of the client computers. #### FAQ for MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677 **What is the scope of the vulnerability?** This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain access to network resources under the privileges of a specific authorized user. **What causes the vulnerability?** This vulnerability is caused when the Internet Authentication Service does not correctly validate an MS-CHAP v2 authentication request. This causes the server to consider the authentication request as valid, even though incorrect credentials may have been provided. **What is the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)?** Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) is a member of the family of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) protocols. PEAP uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create an encrypted channel between an authenticating PEAP client, such as a mobile computer communicating over a wireless network, and a PEAP authenticator, such as an Internet Authentication Service (IAS) or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server. PEAP does not specify an authentication method, but provides additional security for other EAP authentication protocols, such as EAP-MS-CHAP v2, that can operate through the TLS encrypted channel provided by PEAP.

Network Policy Server (NPS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy in Windows Server 2008. NPS is the replacement for Internet Authentication Service (IAS) in Windows Server 2003. Both Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server expose the PEAP MS-CHAP v2 code that is affected by this vulnerability. **Why is the severity of the vulnerability Moderate on Windows operating system clients?** Windows operating system clients contain the vulnerable MS-CHAP v2 code, but none of the components included as part of the operating systems use this code in a way that may expose the vulnerability. Theoretically, a third-party application that supports authentication using MS-CHAP v2 could render a system vulnerable. As clients are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario.

Deployment Information Installing the Update When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994. For more information about the installer, visit the Microsoft TechNet Web site.

Where are the file information details?Refer to the reference tables in the Security Update Deployment section for the location of the file information details. Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only. Why do Automatic Updates and the Microsoft Download Center list a different severity rating for the security update from that listed in the Affected Software table?Some of the affected editions of Windows have different severity ratings for various releases of the operating system. In each case, the downloadable security update packages available from Automatic Updates and the Microsoft Download Center will indicate the highest aggregate severity rating for the operating system. I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin.

Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A remote code execution vulnerability exists in implementations of Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) on the Internet Authentication Service. The vulnerability is due to incorrect copying into memory of messages received by the server when handling PEAP authentication attempts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2505](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-2505). #### Mitigating Factors for Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505 Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: - Servers using Internet Authentication Service are only affected when configured to use PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 authentication. #### Workarounds for Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505 Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality: - **Use an authentication protocol other than PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 on your Internet Authentication Service server** **Impact of workaround.** Changing authentication protocols may require reconfiguration of clients. #### FAQ for Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505 **What is the scope of the vulnerability?** This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. **What causes the vulnerability?** This vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the PEAP authentication requests. This could lead to an error while copying specific memory structures when the IAS server deals with PEAP authentication attempts. **What is the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)?** Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) is a member of the family of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) protocols. PEAP uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create an encrypted channel between an authenticating PEAP client, such as a mobile computer communicating over a wireless network, and a PEAP authenticator, such as an Internet Authentication Service (IAS) or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server. PEAP does not specify an authentication method, but provides additional security for other EAP authentication protocols, such as EAP-MS-CHAP v2, that can operate through the TLS encrypted channel provided by PEAP. PEAP is used as an authentication method for 802.1X wireless client computers, but is not supported for virtual private network (VPN) or other remote access clients. **What is the Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAP v2)?** MS-CHAP uses a challenge-response mechanism to authenticate connections without sending any passwords. MS-CHAP v2 provides mutual authentication, the generation of stronger initial data encryption keys for Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE), and different encryption keys for sent and received data. To minimize the risk of password compromise during a password change, support for older methods of the MS-CHAP password change is not included. MS-CHAP v2 is a mutual authentication protocol, which means that both the client and the server prove that they have knowledge of the user's password. First, the remote access server asks the remote access client for proof by sending a challenge to the client. Then the remote access client asks the remote access server for proof by sending a challenge back to the server. If the server cannot prove that it has knowledge of the user's password by correctly answering the challenge from the client, the client terminates the connection. Without mutual authentication, a remote access client cannot establish a connection to an unauthorized remote access server. **What are Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server?** In Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Internet Authentication Service (IAS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server. As a RADIUS server, IAS performs centralized connection authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of network access, including wireless and virtual private network (VPN) connections. On Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, IAS does not support RADIUS Proxy because it is based on the Option Pack version. In Windows Server 2003, Internet Authentication Service (IAS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy. As a RADIUS server, IAS performs centralized connection authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of network access, including wireless and virtual private network (VPN) connections. As a RADIUS proxy, IAS forwards authentication and accounting messages to other RADIUS servers. Network Policy Server (NPS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy in Windows Server 2008. NPS is the replacement for Internet Authentication Service (IAS) in Windows Server 2003. Both Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server expose the PEAP MS-CHAP v2 code that is affected by this vulnerability. **Why is the severity of the vulnerability Important on Windows operating system clients?** Windows operating system clients contain the vulnerable MS-CHAP v2 code, but none of the components included as part of the operating systems use this code in a way that may expose the vulnerability. Theoretically, a third-party application that supports authentication using MS-CHAP v2 could render a system vulnerable. As clients are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario. However, Microsoft is providing an update as part of this security bulletin that addresses the root cause on client platforms. **Why is the severity of the vulnerability Important on Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems?** Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems does not allow installation of the Internet Authentication Service. However, the vulnerable binaries are present on the machine. Theoretically, a third-party application that supports authentication using MS-CHAP v2 could render a system vulnerable. As these servers are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario. However, Microsoft is providing an update as part of this security bulletin that addresses the root cause on Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems. **What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?** An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with administrator privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts. **How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an incorrectly formed PEAP authentication request to an IAS server. **What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?** Internet Authentication Services servers that allow remote, untrusted users to authenticate are at particular risk from this vulnerability. **What does the update do?** The update changes IAS to correctly validate MS-CHAP v2 authentication requests. **When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?** No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. **When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?** No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued. MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677 ----------------------------------------------------------- An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Internet Authentication Service. An attacker could send a specially crafted Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAP v2) authentication request that could obtain access to network resources under the privileges of a specific, authorized user. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-3677](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-3677). #### Mitigating Factors for MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677 Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: - Servers using Internet Authentication Service are only affected when configured to use PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 authentication. #### Workarounds for MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass in Internet Authentication Service Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677 Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality: - **Use an authentication protocol other than PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 on your Internet Authentication Service server** **Impact of workaround.** Changing authentication protocols may require reconfiguration of the client computers. #### FAQ for MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677 **What is the scope of the vulnerability?** This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain access to network resources under the privileges of a specific authorized user. **What causes the vulnerability?** This vulnerability is caused when the Internet Authentication Service does not correctly validate an MS-CHAP v2 authentication request. This causes the server to consider the authentication request as valid, even though incorrect credentials may have been provided. **What is the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)?** Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) is a member of the family of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) protocols. PEAP uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create an encrypted channel between an authenticating PEAP client, such as a mobile computer communicating over a wireless network, and a PEAP authenticator, such as an Internet Authentication Service (IAS) or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server. PEAP does not specify an authentication method, but provides additional security for other EAP authentication protocols, such as EAP-MS-CHAP v2, that can operate through the TLS encrypted channel provided by PEAP.

Network Policy Server (NPS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy in Windows Server 2008. NPS is the replacement for Internet Authentication Service (IAS) in Windows Server 2003. Both Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server expose the PEAP MS-CHAP v2 code that is affected by this vulnerability. **Why is the severity of the vulnerability Moderate on Windows operating system clients?** Windows operating system clients contain the vulnerable MS-CHAP v2 code, but none of the components included as part of the operating systems use this code in a way that may expose the vulnerability. Theoretically, a third-party application that supports authentication using MS-CHAP v2 could render a system vulnerable. As clients are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario.

As these servers are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario. However, Microsoft is providing an update as part of this security bulletin that addresses the root cause on Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems. **What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?** An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to network resources under the privileges of a specific, authorized user. Note that depending on the authentication requirements of the applications hosted by the network, the user may not directly have access to specific data or information. **How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an incorrectly formed MS-CHAP v2 authentication request to the Internet Authentication Service. **What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?** Systems that use the Internet Authentication Service to provide external users with access to network resources are particularly affected by this vulnerability. **What does the update do?** This update addresses the vulnerability by changing IAS to correctly validate MS-CHAP v2 authentication requests. **When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?** No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. **When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?** No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued. ### Update Information Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance ------------------------------------------- Manage the software and security updates you need to deploy to the servers, desktop, and mobile systems in your organization.

Deployment Information Installing the Update When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994. For more information about the installer, visit the Microsoft TechNet Web site. For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684. This security update supports the following setup switches.
