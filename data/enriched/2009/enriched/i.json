This could be a nuisance in the case where long-running root daemons spawn direct child processes owned by untrusted users [*]. There may even be worse consequences if privileged processes have weak signal handling code for signals not normally triggerable by untrusted users."

        "title": "CVE-2009-0029 Linux Kernel insecure 64 bit system call argument passing",
        "description": "From vendor-sec:Christian Borntraeger found a security relevant problem with the Linux system calls argument passing for at least s390, powerpc, sparc64 and mips:The ABI for some architectures defines that the caller of a function has to sign extend each parameter to full register width. This is a problem in Linux system call handling.For example with this system call on 64 bit:asmlinkage long sys_example(unsigned int index){ if (index > 5) return -EINVAL; return example_array[index];}It would mean that the caller has to sign extend index to 64 bit. In this case the caller is userspace. So we cannot rely on a correct sign extension.But actually we just pass userspace delivered parameters unmodified to the system call function.The above example could break like this:The compiler can create code that will only test the lower 32 bits of the register that contain index to make sure its value is <= 5. However to access the memory location to get the value out of the array it can use the same unmodified (64 bit) register as index register, since the caller had to make sure that the upper 32 bits of the register contain zeroes. But since the value came from user space this isn't guaranteed and can lead to an addressing exception. Or userspace reads or even writes from/to memory locations it is not allowed to have access to.Please note that this has nothing to do with compat system calls. This is an issue with 64 bit kernel and 64 bit userspace but 32 bit arguments.Unfortunately the issue must be considered to be already public:http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=123155111608910&w=2"

Such session identifiers were assigned if user logged out of SquirrelMail and logged in again without closing web browser.This could result in sessions of the multiple users to \"merge\". Certain data from one user's session could have been displayed to other user (such as folder structure, address book and options, but not individual mails), or result in the overwrite of the preferences data with other user's settings.Further details can be found in the bug #480224."

Other interference can also occur (e.g., a user ending their squirrelmail session will also log out other users with the same session ID).Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):squirrelmail-1.4.8-5.el4_7.2How reproducible:AlwaysSteps to Reproduce:1. Exit and restart your web browser, if needed.2. Visit: http://localhost/webmail/src/webmail.php. You will correctly get the \"You must be logged in to access this page\" error.3. Click through to the login page and log in. Actual results:If you examine the SQMSESSID cookie of the session, you will see that it has a value of \"deleted\". Also, if you look in the PHP session directory (/var/lib/php/session/), you will see a session file called \"sess_deleted\" containing information related to the session.Expected results:SQMSESSID should contain a randomly-generated session identifier, and /var/lib/php/session/sess_deleted should never be created.Additional info:This did not occur in the previous release (squirrelmail-1.4.8-4.0.1.el4).The following patch to functions/global.php appears to treat the symptom, but is not a complete fix:--- /usr/share/squirrelmail/functions/global.php 2008-12-01 07:23:39.000000000 -0500+++ global.php 2009-01-15 14:00:28.000000000 -0500@@ -427,6 +427,10 @@ @session_start(); // could be: sq_call_function_suppress_errors('session_start'); $session_id = session_id();+ if ($session_id == 'deleted') {+ session_regenerate_id();+ $session_id = session_id();+ } // session_starts sets the sessionid cookie but without the httponly var // setting the cookie again sets the httponly cookie attribute"

To do this the attackerneeds to accurately guess the client's randomly chosen 16-bittransaction ID and insert the attack precisely between the client'srequest and the valid DHCPv4 server's reply.Neither of these are likely on a well defended network but clients thatare roaming may find them, especially the first, a severe threat.2) The attacker would then need to develop their attack within a limitedpacket size.Support for DHCPv4 total packet size may be limited from 576 octetsthrough the link MTU size (no support for fragmentation) up to 64KB. Ofthis, the DHCPv4 option payload space is limited by the space taken upby the BOOTP header space, excepting the FILE and SNAME fields (whichcan be used in 'option overloading' to carry option contents, such asthe subnet-mask)."

        "title": "CVE-2009-0835 kernel: x86-64: seccomp: 32/64 syscall hole",
        "description": "Description of problem:Various security technologies make use of syscall filtering. Such technologies are very powerful because they restrict a compromise not just in terms of access to files, networks and processes -- but also access to the rich kernel API (a great source of ring 0 bugs).Syscall filtering technologies typically make an allow / deny decision based on the syscall (identified by a number) and sometimes also the exact arguments to the syscall. A vulnerability exists due to the identification of syscall by number. On 64-bit aware Linux kernels (x86_64), the syscall number can map to either the 32-bit or 64-bit syscall table. Since the syscall tables are different for 32-bit vs. 64-bit, and the user space process gets to control which table it hits, the syscall number check can often be fooled.For example, a syscall filter technology might be monitoring a 64-bit process, and configured to allow some subset of the very common open() syscall. That's syscall number 2 in 64-bit land. However, the monitored process can switch to 32-bit mode and issue syscall 2. That appears to be open() to the monitor but will execute as fork() in the kernel - possibly leading to an unmonitored process.Here is a sample piece of code which does a 32-bit syscall:intmain(int argc, const char* argv[]){ /* Syscall 1 is exit on i386 but write on x86_64. */ asm volatile(\"movl $1, %eax\\n\" \"int $0x80\\n\"); for (;;);}When built 64-bit, and run under strace on my 64-bit machine, the difference in opinion on the syscall is apparent:write(1, \"\\370V\\355\\365\\377\\177\", 140737319359320 <unfinished ... exit status 208>The monitor sees write() but the kernel sees (and executes!) exit().Detecting this situation has some subtleties. Which syscall table the kernel hits depends on both the instruction used to trap into the kernel, and also the \"long mode\" bit in the current descriptor referred to by the code segment (CS) register. int80 and sysenter always cause a 32-bit syscall, but syscall looks at the descriptor. Therefore, to securely monitor a 32-bit process, it is sufficient just to validate that the CS register references a privileged 32-bit descriptor. Unfortunately, to securely monitor a 64-bit process, not only must the CS register be checked, but the instruction initiating the syscall must be checked. This involves reading user-space which is of course is subject to well-documented lethal race conditions when other processes which share writeable address space.http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2009-001.htmlhttp://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2009/01/bypassing-syscall-filtering.html"

These issues have been assigned CVE-2009-0948.These issues only affect file 5.00, and not earlier versions, due to introduced support for CDF (Common Document Format) files in file 5.00. Because of this, only Fedora 11 is affected by these issues."

        "description": "A heap overflow flaw was found in a regular expression parser in the NSS library used to match common names in certificates. A malicious site could present a carefully crafted certificate in such a way as to trigger the heap overflow leading to a crash or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running a browser such as firefox.The overflow happens when the browser checks if the hostname of the site you are visiting matches the Common Name (CN) field of the presented certificate. This check (cert_TestHostName) only happens automatically if the certificate is one that is signed by a Certificate Authority you have previously trusted. If the attacker presents a malicious self-signed certificate, or one signed by an untrusted CA, the user is presented with a dialog box about the certificate before the vulnerable function is called. If the user chooses to accept the certificate then the vulnerable function is called and the heap overflow happens. So this issue does require slightly more user interaction to be exploited.Co-incidentally, the handling of regular expressions for NSS versions 3.12.3 and above was changed to use a different and simpler regular expression routine which is not vulnerable to this issue. Therefore where a system has NSS 3.12.3 installed, it is not vulnerable to this issue by default. (Although it is possible to change Firefox back to use the old vulnerable library it is not something that is expected users to have done, and is not an obvious documented ability)For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Firefox uses the system provided NSS library. This library was updated to a versions greater than 3.12.3 by RHBA-2009:1161 on 20th July 2009. Therefore systems updated to RHBA-2009:1161 are protected by default from this issue.For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Firefox uses the system provided NSS library. This library is due to be updated to a version greater than 3.12.3 and this will probably happen within the week (so before the embargo lifts).For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 we do not ship Firefox but instead SeaMonkey which provides the NSS library. SeaMonkey will need updating to correct this issue."

        "description": "In his upcoming Blackhat paper and presentation Dan Kaminskyhighlights some more issues he has found relating to SSL hashcollisions and related vulnerabilities.The first issue is the discovery that a widely-trusted CertificateAuthority root certificate is self-signed using a MD2 hash. If anattacker can mint a fake intermediate certificate which has the sameMD2 hash then they could use this on a malicious site (or during aman-in-the-middle attack) to present a fake SSL certificate that wouldbe accepted as if it was authentic.It turns out that there are not many valid MD2 hash certificatesaround any more, and the main one that exists is at the trusted rootlevel anyway (and there is actually no need for a crypto library toverify the self-signature on a trusted root). So most vendors havechosen to address this issue by disabling MD2 completely forcertificate verification.There is no immediate panic to address this issue as in order for itto be exploited the attacker would need to create the MD2 collisionwith the root certificate, something that is as of today a significantamount of effort (even with a highly distributed effort it's a bitoutside what is feasible).So for upstream OpenSSL we have disabled MD2 support completely. Thiswas done in two stages; the first was a patch in June 2009(http://marc.info/?l=openssl-cvs&m=124508133203041&w=2) that removedthe check of a trusted root self-signed certificate. Then MD2 wasdisabled in July, (http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=18381). Although there have not yet been anyupstream releases containing these fixes, future OpenSSL 0.9.8 (after0.9.8k), and OpenSSL 1.0.0 releases will contain this fix.The GnuTLS library has for some time meant to have disabled MD2support, although due to a broken patch it wasn't actually disabledcorrectly until the start of 2009. So this is addressed in GnuTLSversions 2.6.4 and above, and 2.7.4 and above.(http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2008-12/msg00011.html)The NSS library since version 3.12.3 (April 2009) has disabled MD2 bydefault (although legacy applications can turn it back on using anenvironment variable \"NSS_ALLOW_WEAK_SIGNATURE_ALG\" if they need to).Mozilla Firefox since version 3.5 has used this NSS version andtherefore MD2 is disabled(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=471539#c58)"

        "description": "Description of problem:Dan Walsh's blog post mentioned in the previous comment details selinux-policypart of the issue tracked via bug #512284. As noted in the the blog,selinux-policy provides a boolean - allow_unconfined_mmap_low - which controlswhether mmap_min_addr restriction is applied to the process. This boolean,however, did not work as expected, as unconfined_t domain (default domain forlogged-in unprivileged users) was always permitted to map low memory pagesregardless of the boolean setting. This problem with the boolean is beingfixed and the fix will be included in future selinux-policy updates in RHEL5and Fedora (see Dan's blog for NVRs).Few notes specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5:Support for mmap_min_addr sysctl was not included in the GA version of RHEL5. It was only added in kernel update in 5.2 (it first appeared upstream in2.6.24). selinux-policy was, to avoid breaking applications needing low memorypages mapping on upgrade from 5.1 to 5.2, configured to allow mmap_zero inunconfined domains and only disallow it in confined domains (e.g. variousnetwork facing services). In 5.3, allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean was added,but it's default value for targeted policy was changed to on, i.e. allowingmmap_zero in all unconfined domains by default. This default boolean value isplanned to remain unchanged in 5.4.It should also be noted, that even with allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean setto off, it is still possible for unconfined_t user to transition to otherdomain that is permitted to mmap_zero, as details in the Dan's blog post. Upstream discussion on how to best address this issue is still ongoing.Eric's proposed patches moving mmap_min_addr check out of security weresubmitted. If they are accepted upstream, mmap_min_addr will be checked beforeLSM hooks are called. Security modules will only be consulted if mmap_min_addrcheck has passed (e.g. when mmap_min_addr is 0), so SELinux may still be ableto restrict mapping of the low pages / zero page for confined domains andpermit mapping in unconfined, even when mmap_min_addr is 0.Eric's patches with further discussion:http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36540/http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36539/Updated version:http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36650/http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36649/Further discussion of the proposed change:http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.lsm/9075mmap_min_addr on SELinux and non-SELinux systemshttp://eparis.livejournal.com/606.htmlConfining the unconfined.

Comment #2 From dijuremo (dijuremo@gatech.edu) 2009-09-11 12:08:12 EDT (-) [reply] [edit] ------- PrivateI can confirm this same problem, I originally found the issue on my fileservers serving nfs and samba along with drbd after updating to 5.4. It allseems related to the kernel 2.6.18-164.el5. Having all the rpms from 5.4 andusing the older kernel 2.6.18-128.7.1.el5 fixed the problem, so this is mostlikely a kernel issue.I actually kickstarted a new machine, configured it as an nfs server and wasable to reproduce the problem.I think the priority and severity of this request should be elevated to HIGH!!!On the server:[root@phys-ha01 ~]# cat /etc/exports/ phys41012.physics.gatech.edu(fsid=0,rw,sync,no_root_squash,nohide)/web phys41012.physics.gatech.edu(rw,sync,no_root_squash,nohide)/tmp phys41012.physics.gatech.edu(rw,sync,no_root_squash,nohide)/tmp/test phys41012.physics.gatech.edu(rw,sync,no_root_squash,nohide)/ phys-ha01.physics.gatech.edu(fsid=0,rw,sync,no_root_squash,nohide)/web phys-ha01.physics.gatech.edu(rw,sync,no_root_squash,nohide)/tmp phys-ha01.physics.gatech.edu(rw,sync,no_root_squash,nohide)/tmp/test phys-ha01.physics.gatech.edu(rw,sync,no_root_squash,nohide)On the client:[root@phys41012 ~]# mount -t nfs4 -v -orw,nosuid,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,hard,intrphys-ha01.physics.gatech.edu:/tmp/test /tmp/non-drbd/[dr126@phys41012 tmp]$ cd /tmp/non-drbd/[dr126@phys41012 non-drbd]$ mount | grep drbdphys-ha01.physics.gatech.edu:/tmp/test on /tmp/non-drbd type nfs4(rw,nosuid,rsize=32768,wsize=[dr126@phys41012 non-drbd]$ ls -latotal 24drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Sep 11 11:30 .drwxrwxrwt 28 root root 4096 Sep 11 11:30 ..drwx------ 2 dr126 root 4096 Sep 11 11:38 dr126[dr126@phys41012 non-drbd]$ cd dr126/[dr126@phys41012 dr126]$ ls -latotal 16drwx------ 2 dr126 root 4096 Sep 11 11:38 .drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Sep 11 11:30 ..-rw------- 1 dr126 nobody 0 Sep 11 11:38 test---------- 1 dr126 nobody 0 Mar 18 1973 .test2.swo--wSrwSrwT 1 dr126 nobody 0 Mar 18 1973 .test2.swp---------- 1 dr126 nobody 0 Mar 18 1973 .test.swo--wSrwS-wt 1 dr126 nobody 0 Mar 18 1973 .test.swp[dr126@phys41012 dr126]$ rm -rf test .test*[dr126@phys41012 dr126]$ touch testfile[dr126@phys41012 dr126]$ ls -la testfile-rw------- 1 dr126 nobody 0 Sep 11 11:43 testfile[dr126@phys41012 dr126]$ vi test[dr126@phys41012 dr126]$ ls -latotal 16drwx------ 2 dr126 root 4096 Sep 11 11:43 .drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Sep 11 11:30 ..-rw------- 1 dr126 nobody 0 Sep 11 11:43 testfile---------- 1 dr126 nobody 0 Mar 22 1973 .test.swo---------- 1 dr126 nobody 0 Mar 22 1973 .test.swp Comment #3 From dijuremo (dijuremo@gatech.edu) 2009-09-11 13:53:44 EDT (-) [reply] [edit] ------- PrivateNot sure whether or not this helps, but if you are writing as root from thenfs4 client, then the writes work correctly.

Comment #4 From Anders Wäänänen (waananen@nbi.dk) 2009-09-13 17:04:37 EDT (-) [reply] [edit] ------- PrivateI can also confirm this. I do believe that the problem is related to O_EXCLflag to open(2). Try to run mktemp (user of open(2) with O_EXCL) and try togenerate a temporary file on the filesystem. It seems that creating fileswithoutO_EXCL is ok.Anders Comment #5 From Jeff Layton (jlayton@redhat.com) 2009-09-14 09:45:44 EDT (-) [reply] [edit] ------- PrivateGoing ahead and marking this a regression based on comment #2 Comment #6 From Jeff Layton (jlayton@redhat.com) 2009-09-14 11:57:12 EDT (-) [reply] [edit] ------- PrivateI've narrowed it down as far as do_open_permission returning error.

The client is then supposed to go back and resetthose values with a SETATTR call if the create was successful.What's happening here is that the inital create is occurring, but then thepermission check for the open fails. This short-circuits the rest of theprocess, causes the open to return an error and leaves the inode in this funkystate. That also explains why we don't see this problem with root...thepermission check is always passing there (provided we're not root squashing).The modes are a little disturbing too actually. I believe nfsd is generallypassing an uninitialized value for the mode to the vfs_create call. In somecases, the mode just happens to end up allowing the permission check to pass.Those are shown by testfile_Lp7607 and testfile_EV7164 in the above list.If this hypothesis is correct there are 2 possibilties for fixing it:1) ensure that the create mode is set in such a way that the subsequentpermission check succeeds2) always allow the permission check to succeed in this caseIt's not clear to me whether and how this was fixed upstream, so I may need todo some similar investigation there. Comment #8 From Jeff Layton (jlayton@redhat.com) 2009-09-14 13:12:12 EDT (-) [reply] [edit] ------- PrivateSo to be clear...while this is technically a regression from 5.3, I think thepatch that went into 5.4 is actually correct and just ended up exposing anotherbug in this code. Comment #9 From Jeff Layton (jlayton@redhat.com) 2009-09-14 15:34:43 EDT (-) [reply] [edit] ------- PrivateOk, I see part of the problem...In the nfsd4_open struct, the verifier and the iattrs are a union. Forexclusive creates, the verifier field is intended to be used. For othercreates, the iattr piece may be used.The bogus modes come about because we're setting the verifier, and then laterdereferencing the iattr part of that union. This gives us crazy ia_valid valuesand possibly modes as well...This seems to have been inadvertantly fixed upstream as part of the NFSv4.1code merge with commit 79fb54abd285b442e1f30f851902f3ddf58e7704. That patchseparated the union into 2 fields for other reasons, but probably fixed this aswell.That should fix the bogus modes by making it so that the mode is set to S_IFREGon create. That will probably not completely fix the problem though...it willprobably still fail the following permission check, but that should at leastmake things consistent. Comment #11 From Jeff Layton (jlayton@redhat.com) 2009-09-15 09:13:10 EDT (-) [reply] [edit] ------- PrivateCreated an attachment (id=361079) [details]patchset #2This set of patches should be a complete fix. It includes the patch that Iposted yesterday, plus two other patches. One is a cosmetic patch to clean upthe indentation in do_open_lookup, and the other makes the permissions checkconditional on whether the file was actually created.All 3 patches are backports from upstream, and fix the reproducer I have forthis.

Locke (blocke@newpaltz.edu) 2009-09-17 13:38:41 EDT (-) [reply] [edit] ------- PrivateI'm afraid I can't open a direct support case as we're using academic licensingand I'd rather chew off my arm then deal with our hardware vendor's supportteam.What I can say is that I saw a related issue on our systems and the test kernelabove fixes our issue.We didn't notice the randomized permissions. In our case many calls in java tojava.io.UnixFileSystem.createFileExclusively failed and rolling the kernel backor using your test kernel fixes the issue.In your example it shows a major security issue with DAC permissions beingrandomized with a good chance of a file being uploaded through a webapp beinggranted SUID and execute. That isn't enough of a reason?Thanks for all your efforts so far.

Isn't it obvious that anybody running nfs4 on RHEL 5.4 will have this problem?I guess that 5.4 being so new, it has not yet made it into big commercialinstallations as they seem to hold off updating, but this is just such acritical problem with a very commonly used service that as soon as the bigcompanies start deploying 5.4 they are going to find themselves in a huge messwith all their nfs servers broken if this is not fixed. I guess at least we canrun with your patched kernel -165, but that one is not really \"official\".I have asked my campus fellows with support contracts to open tickets, add1953460 and 1953404 to the list.

        "description": "A Debian bug report [1] indicates that backintime chmods files to mode 0777 prior to removing them via removing a snapshot. What makes this worse is that if those files exist in subsequent snapshots, the permissions on those files is also mode 0777 which allows anyone to manipulate/delete the files in the backup.Looking at this further, if I set the backintime backup directory to, say /srv/backups/$USER, and were to have multiple users on the system, each user would be able to see the other's backup files. Granted, permissions are mimicked from the source, so if a file is 0644 at the source, it will be in the backup as well. However, I think it might be prudent if /srv/backups/$USER was also owned $USER:$USER and mode 0700.The file in question is common/snapshots.py which contains:316 path = self.get_snapshot_path( snapshot_id )317 cmd = \"chmod -R a+rwx \"%s\"\" % path318 self._execute( cmd )319 cmd = \"rm -rfv \"%s\"\" % path320 self._execute( cmd )I'm not sure what the logic behind chmoding those files in the first place is. Obviously the user had to have read-permissions to get the files into the backup in the first place so they should all be owned by the user, meaning chmodding the files is relatively useless. The debian report suggests changing the chmod call to a find call and just changing the mode of directories, but I'm not convinced that's even necessary if the directories are owned by the user to begin with.There are also two places where this call is made:% grep -r 'chmod -R a+rwx' *common/snapshots.py: cmd = \"chmod -R a+rwx \"%s\"\" % pathcommon/snapshots.py: self._execute( \"chmod -R a+rwx \"%s\"\" % new_snapshot_path )so the second invocation likely needs to be changed as well.This would affect Fedora 10, Fedora 11, and rawhide.[1] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=543785"

The pingee has a rtl8169 NIC.I configure MTU of both machine, the pinger is set to 9000 and the pingee is set to 7200.Then I execute flood ping from the pinger to pingee by execute ping -f -s 3000 <pingee's IP>, few seconds later the pingee crashed.Crash doesn't occur when using ping -f <pingee's IP> (i.e. don't send large packets).Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):rhel-5.4 with kernel-2.6.18-160.el5How reproducible:as described above.Actual results:few seconds after executing ping -f -s 3000, the pingee gives out the error message, then crashes:PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0<Repeated Many Many Times>PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0HARDWARE ERRORCPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 7 Bank 4: bc0000000005001bRIP 10:<ffffffff8006b2b0> {default_idle+0x29/0x50}TSC 10116da2355 ADDR 4000000 MISC c008000001000000 This is not a software problem!Run through mcelog --ascii to decode and contact your hardware vendorKernel panic - not syncing: Uncorrected machine check <7>APIC error on CPU2: 00(08)the pinger prints dots on screen(since no reply received) repeatedly.Expected results:the pingee doesn't crash, or the pingee refuses the flood ping(since flood ping usually used as a kind of DoS attack).Additional info:"

        "description": "+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #505640 +++Description of problem:I was attempting the implement the client side of QEMU's VNC extension for capturing audio streams. In doing so I typo'd and sent a uint8_t instead of a uint16_t for one of the fields. QEMU noticed the bogus data, printed a message and then crashed with double-free memory corruption. It is trivially reproduceable and allows a remote client to crash any QEMU instance running VNCI'm not sure whether this has security implications or not, so marked this bug security sensitive.Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):qemu-0.10-16.fc11How reproducible:AlwaysSteps to Reproduce:1.

However, most do not test that this has been done, and will proceed to dereference a null pointer. This may result in a security vulnerability, since some ioctls are unprivileged.This adds a macro for the common initialisation test and changes all ioctl implementations that require prior initialisation to use that macro.Also, r128_do_init_cce() does not test that the CCE state has not been initialised already. Repeated initialisation may lead to a crash or resource leak. This adds that test.http://git.kernel.org/linus/7dc482dfeeeefcfd000d4271c4626937406756d7Other references:http://secunia.com/advisories/36707/"

The vulnerabilities lead to arbitrary code execution with the privilege of the target user running the decoders. The directory traversal vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization of the file name used for saving the attachments, as it is computed directly from properties contained in the TNEF structure without checking for conditions that allow to traverse outside the temporary directory used for attachment storage. This leads to arbitrary code execution in case the attacker crafts an attachment that would overwrite a file used for execution (as an example the bashrc profile). Additionally buffer and heap overflow vulnerabilities can be triggered by passing a file name exceeding a fixed size of 256 bytes in the TNEF data structure. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited.Further details can be found in Yorick's advisory: http://www.akitasecurity.nl/advisory.php?id=AK20090601There's no official upstream fix for the issues. Both yTNEF and Evolution's TNEF plugin are unmaintained according to oCERT's advisory."

The vulnerabilities lead to arbitrary code execution with the privilege of the target user running the decoders. The directory traversal vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization of the file name used for saving the attachments, as it is computed directly from properties contained in the TNEF structure without checking for conditions that allow to traverse outside the temporary directory used for attachment storage. This leads to arbitrary code execution in case the attacker crafts an attachment that would overwrite a file used for execution (as an example the bashrc profile). Additionally buffer and heap overflow vulnerabilities can be triggered by passing a file name exceeding a fixed size of 256 bytes in the TNEF data structure. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited.Further details can be found in Yorick's advisory: http://www.akitasecurity.nl/advisory.php?id=AK20090601There's no official upstream fix for the issues. Both yTNEF and Evolution's TNEF plugin are unmaintained according to oCERT's advisory."

I noticed a PDF I was working on caused printing to fail, and it appears that some of the debugging output (which pstoraster turns on) from the gs cups driver can trigger a buffer overflow in the gs debug handling (which uses vsprintf - bad bad bad).I think there are two issues here. One is that somehow gs ended up with MediaType argument without null termination (at least that's how it appears). The other is that ghostscript's print handling code uses (v)sprintf when it should be using (v)snprintf. In fact, ghostscript uses (v)sprintf with an \"%s\" format modifier over 50 times in the source code, several instances of which are probably unsafe (such as here).Consider the following code from base/gsmisc.c:int errprintf(const gs_memory_t *mem, const char *fmt, ...) {... char buf[PRINTF_BUF_LENGTH];... count = vsprintf(buf, fmt, args); errwrite(mem, buf, count); if (count >= PRINTF_BUF_LENGTH) { count = sprintf(buf, \"PANIC: printf exceeded %d bytes. Stack has been corrupted.\\n\", PRINTF_BUF_LENGTH); errwrite(mem, buf, count); }...Just marvellous -- ghostscript expects vsprintf to return sanely if it overflows (which it doesn't), and then expects to print a nice panic message. It would be a 5 line patch to fix this so that it uses vsnprintf, and if count+1 exceeds the buffer length then it can print a warning that the message was truncated instead. Same goes for outprintf.I will attach the stack trace from gdb, the cups error log and the PDF which caused the problem.I wasn't sure if this was security-sensitive or not, but I ticked the box just to be on the safe side. With all the sanity checking that gcc adds to (v)sprintf these days, it's probably very hard to exploit.Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):ghostscript-8.70-1.fc12.i686How reproducible:No idea - works every time on this PDF though.Steps to Reproduce:1. Open PDF in evince2. Print PDF to any printer3. Wait for message saying \"printing failed\" or somesuch.Additional info:To attach gdb, I put a 'sleep 20' command in the pstoraster shell script (/usr/lib/cups/filter/pstoraster) just before it executed gs, then I \"printed\" the PDF, found the sleeping bash process and attached gdb to it."

        "description": "Description of problem:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-50.html#Security Fix: Replication: It was possible when using statement-based replication to subvert the MySQL privilege system on a slave with a higher server release version number than that of the master by using version-specific comments in statements run on the master.A more detailed explanation follows:In MySQL, a version-specific comment is an SQL comment of the form /*!nnnnn sql */ where nnnnn represents a MySQL release version number and sql represents a string of SQL, or a portion of a string of SQL, that should be executed by the MySQL Server only if the server version is at least version n.nn. (For additional information and an example, see Section 8.6, “Comment Syntax”.)In MySQL replication, the slave SQL thread executes with the SUPER privilege, regardless of the privileges with which statements are originally executed on the master. Specific to this issue, when using statement-based replication it was possible, when the slave was of a higher MySQL version than the master, to run statements that would have failed on the master due to insufficient privileges, except that these statements were wrapped in version-specific comments where the encoded version was greater than the MySQL server version of the master. However, if the MySQL release version of the slave was equal to or greater than the version encoded in the comment, the same statements could execute on this slave whose MySQL release version was less than the version number used in the comment.Suppose that a master running MySQL 5.1.48 replicated to a slave running MySQL 4.1.49, and that a user user1 had privileges to run UPDATE statements on database db1 but no privileges at all on the mysql system database, so that the first of the following two statements succeeded, but the second statement failed, and thus the first statement was written to the binary log, but the second statement was not: UPDATE db1.tb1 SET db1.tbl1.col1=2; UPDATE mysql.user SET mysql.user.Super_priv='Y' WHERE mysql.user.User='user1';However, the text of the second statement could be wrapped in version-specific comments and thus “hidden” within the text of the first statement so that this new version of the first statement succeeded, and was written in its entireity to the binary log. The new statement containing the necessary portions of the statement affecting the “mysql.user” table wrapped within version-specific comments is shown here:UPDATE db1.tbl1 /*!514900 ,mysql.user */ SET db1.tbl1.col1=2 /*!514900 ,mysql.user.Super_priv='Y' WHERE mysql.user.User='user1'*/;Thus, a 5.1.48 master would see this statement as identical to the first of the original two statements shown previously (UPDATE db1.tb1 SET db1.tbl1.col1=2). However, the version-specific comments within the statement just shown, when run on the MySQL 5.1.49 slave, were ignored; thus the slave SQL thread would execute the statement, as shown here, with the SUPER privilege, on the slave: UPDATE db1.tbl1,mysql.user SET db1.tbl1.col1=2,mysql.user.Super_priv='Y' WHERE mysql.user.User='user1';To fix this issue, the ! (exclamation) character is now stripped from comments prior to statements containing them being applied on replication slaves; thus, version-specific comments that are not applied on the master are treated as normal comments on the slave and also not applied there.

The patch is in use by couple of distributions for some time.+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #531160 +++The ldd attempts to display a list of dynamic linkages by executing the target binary with an \"magic environment\" setting. For a normal binary that's been compiled and linked with glibc and the normal GNU linker this will be adequate.However, crafted sources linked against an alternative library and linker can execute arbitrary code in lieu (or in addition to) this.Because most sysadmins are not aware of this behavior they will have the (reasonable) expectation that ldd is inspecting the target's headers (as data) rather than EXECUTING them.

        "description": "While investigating GnuTLS issue CVE-2014-1959 (bug 1065092), it was discovered that older versions of GnuTLS were affected by the same problem, with a different root cause. When using default certificate verification settings, GnuTLS accepted version 1 X.509 certificates as intermediate CAs. An attacker able to obtain a V1 certificate from a CA trusted by application could generate certificates for other hosts or users that would be accepted by GnuTLS.This issue affected GnuTLS versions before 2.7.6. Problem was reported in the following post:http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351/focus=3361and fixed upstream via:https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/c8dcbedd1fdc312f5b1a70fcfbc1afe235d800cdThis did not affect applications that used GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT verification flag, which instructs GnuTLS to allow root CA certificates to be version 1 certificates. This was set by e.g. gnutls-cli client application in GnuTLS versions affected by this bug.This issue affects gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Versions used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or current Fedora versions are newer than 2.7.6 and are not affected."

        "title": "CVE-2009-1633 kernel: cifs: fix potential buffer overruns when converting unicode strings sent by server",
        "description": "From Jeff Layton:The cifs code regularly has to convert strings from ucs2_le (a double byte encoding scheme used on windows) to the local NLS charset. The routines that do this have a very poor scheme for handling buffer lengths.The string conversion routines accept only a single length parameter specified in units of the number of wide characters that it should try to convert. It's assumed therefore that the destination buffer will be big enough. Some measures are in place now to try to ensure this, but they really aren't sufficient. What's needed is a new set of conversion routines that take both the source and destination buffer lengths into account.The patchset adds these routines and converts the appropriate callers to use them. In addition, it removes a very large piece of \"experimental\" NTLMSSP code that I found to be completely unreachable. That code was using the old routines and it's simpler (and better) to just remove that code rather than convert it.The upstream commits are:http://git.kernel.org/linus/27b87fe52baba0a55e9723030e76fce94fabcea4http://git.kernel.org/linus/afe48c31ea5c74eaac58621ce1c85ae8187c4383http://git.kernel.org/linus/18295796a30cada84e933d805072dc2248d54f98http://git.kernel.org/linus/9e39b0ae8af46c83b85dae7ff5251911a80fce5ahttp://git.kernel.org/linus/d185cda7712fd1d9e349174639d76eadc66679behttp://git.kernel.org/linus/2edd6c5b0517b9131ede9e74cb121898ccd73042http://git.kernel.org/linus/20418acd6874792359b42c12d159f42f17593f34http://git.kernel.org/linus/f58841666bc22e827ca0dcef7b71c7bc2758ce82http://git.kernel.org/linus/460b96960d1946914e50316ffeefe7b41dddce91http://git.kernel.org/linus/59140797c5817363087b0ffb46e6bb81a11fe0dchttp://git.kernel.org/linus/cc20c031bb067eb3280a1c4b5c42295093e24863http://git.kernel.org/linus/066ce6899484d9026acd6ba3a8dbbedb33d7ae1bhttp://git.kernel.org/linus/69f801fcaa03be83d58c564f00913b7c172808e4http://git.kernel.org/linus/7fabf0c9479fef9fdb9528a5fbdb1cb744a744a4http://git.kernel.org/linus/66345f50f070ae7412a28543ee197cb5eff73598http://git.kernel.org/linus/d37dc42ab6f040b8f0f2962ab219c5b2accf748dhttp://git.kernel.org/linus/7b0c8fcff47a885743125dd843db64af41af5a61http://git.kernel.org/linus/968460ebd8006d55661dec0fb86712b40d71c413http://git.kernel.org/linus/341060273232a2df0d1a7fa53abc661fcf22747cUpdate (May 15, 2009):And this commit too:cifs: fix error handling in parse_DFS_referralshttp://git.kernel.org/linus/d8e2f53ac99f4ce7d63807a84f98d1b80df598cf(this patch is in Steve's tree but not yet in Linus'.
