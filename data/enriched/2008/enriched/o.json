This flaw could potentially be used to evade web-site input filters and result in a XSS attack hazard. While investigating, Mozilla developer Simon Montagu discovered several variants of this flaw involving zero-length non-ASCII sequences in ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-KR, and HZ-GB-2312.

Myers reported a weakness in the trust model used by Mozilla regarding alternate names on self-signed certificates (and those with mismatched names) that if accepted could be used to spoof a secure connection to any other site. This problem was independently reported by Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann. In Firefox 2 and earlier Mozilla-based browsers, when a user encounters a site with a self-signed certificate or one whose name does not exactly match the name in the certificate an error dialog is presented that allows the user to reject the certificate, or accept it as valid and access the site. There was no concept of partial trust, accepting the certificate as valid marked it as trusted for all information it contained, including alternate site names. These alternate names could be viewed as part of the certificate details, but since they were not present on the initial dialog many users could be fooled into accepting a certificate for a site they didn't care about (but wanted to see) that also asserted that it was a certificate for your bank or prominent online shop. Once accepted this certificate could be used to spoof that site or perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. The dialog has been changed in Firefox 2.0.0.15 to list the alternate names and users should not accept certificates that claim an unreasonable set of alternate names. Certificate handling in Firefox 3 is quite different and it was not susceptible to this vulnerability. In Firefox 3 there is no dialog to accept self-signed certificates, and when users do choose to make an exception to the SSL security model the certificate is only trusted for that one listed exception, not for any other site."

        "description": "Mozilla community member Geoff reported that URL shortcut files on Windows (for example, saved IE favorites) could be interpreted as if they were in the local file context when opened by Firefox, although the referenced remote content would be downloaded and displayed. Scripts loaded from the remote site would have access to all local file content in Firefox 2 if they were programmed to look for it. Exploiting this vulnerability would involve first fooling the user into saving such a shortcut to a malicious site--typically from some other program since Firefox does not use this format--and then find the saved file on the desktop and choose to open it with Firefox. In affected pre-release versions of Firefox 3 the vulnerability was further mitigated by the additional restrictions on file content that prevent searching the local disk in this manner. Malicious scripts could only read from files with known names stored in the same folder (or sub-folder) as the shortcut."

        "description": "Security researcher Billy Rios reported that if Firefox is not already running, passing it a command-line URI with pipe (\"|\") symbols will open multiple tabs. This URI splitting could be used to launch chrome: URIs from the command-line, a partial bypass of the fix for MFSA 2005-53 which was intended to block external applications from loading such URIs (that vulnerability remains fixed, however). This vulnerability could also be used by an attacker to pass URIs to Firefox that would normally be handled by a vector application by appending it to a URI not handled by the vector application. For example, web browsers normally handle file: URIs themselves, or block them from web content altogether, but this flaw enabled attackers to pass them from another browser into Firefox. In Firefox 2 scripts running from file: URIs can read data from a user's entire disk, a risk if the attacker could first place a malicious file in a guessable location on the local disk. Rios demonstrated that the so-called \"Safari Carpet-bombing vulnerability\" could be used for this, as well as another technique that does not rely on that now-fixed Safari vulnerability. In Firefox 3 scripts running in local files have limited access to other files, almost entirely mitigating the file: attack. However, combined with a vulnerability which allows an attacker to inject script into a chrome document the above issue could be used to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer. Such a chrome injection vulnerability was discovered in Firefox 3 by Mozilla developers Ben Turner and Dan Veditz. In the absence of the attack described by Billy Rios this injection attack would not run with any special privilege and would be at best a spoofing vulnerability. Workaround This attack only works if the user is using another internet-connected application with Firefox not running. Using Firefox, or making sure it is at least running, prevents this attack."

        "description": "Security researcher Collin Jackson reported that the -moz-binding CSS property can be used to bypass security checks which validate codebase principals. Similar to the issue reported in MFSA 2008-23, Jackson demonstrated that an attacker can replace a stylesheet in a signed JAR which uses relative paths, and can then use the -moz-binding property to inject malicious script into the JAR. The injected script will be executed with the privileges of the signed JAR. This vulnerability can thus allow an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript within the context of another site.

Even with cookies turned off, this issue could be used by a website to write persistent data in a user's browser and track the user across browsing sessions.

        "description": "Google security researcher Chris Evans reported that a website could access a limited amount of data from a different domain by loading a same-domain JavaScript URL which redirects to an off-domain target resource containing data which is not parsable as JavaScript. Upon attempting to load the data as JavaScript a syntax error is generated that can reveal some of the file context via the window.onerror DOM API. This issue could be used by a malicious website to steal private data from users who are authenticated on the redirected website. How much data could be at risk would depend on the format of the data and how the JavaScript parser attempts to interpret it. For most files the amount of data that can be recovered would be limited to the first word or two. Some data files might allow deeper probing with repeated loads. Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in mail. Update December 18, 2008: The Windows version of Firefox 2.0.0.19 was shipped without the fix for this issue (other platforms were correctly patched). Firefox 2.0.0.20 has been released on Windows to correct this oversight. Workaround Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be installed."

IBM researchers Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William also reported a related symptom as part of their research that resulted in MFSA 2008-37. There was no direct security impact from this issue and its effect was limited to the improper rendering of hyperlinks containing specific characters. The severity of this issue was determined to be low."
