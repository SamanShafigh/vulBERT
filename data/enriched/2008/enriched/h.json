This traversal was possible only when the browser had installed add-ons which used \"flat\" packaging rather than the more popular .jar packaging, and the attacker would need to target that specific add-on.Mozilla also reports that this vulnerability can be exploited in Mozilla web browsers to obtain cookie data and information about currently opened webpages from the sessionstore.js file.Mozilla has released a partial list of \"flat\" packaged extentions.",

        "overview": "Microsoft Windows fails to properly handle the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value, which may prevent Windows from effectively disabling AutoRun and AutoPlay features.",
        "description": "AutoRun, which was introduced with Windows 95, is a feature that causes Windows to automatically take an action when a removable media device is inserted. For example, when an AutoRun-enabled CD-ROM is inserted, Windows may automatically execute a program on that disc. This also holds true for U3-enabled USB devices, which emulate a CD-ROM device as well as provide USB mass storage capabilities. These devices can automatically execute code when they are inserted into a Windows system. The AutoRun action can also take place when the user clicks the icon for an AutoRun-enabled device. AutoRun is enabled by default in Windows. AutoPlay, which was introduced with Windows XP, extends AutoRun capabilities to also allow a menu to be presented to the user, which lists actions that the user may take. AutoRun and AutoPlay can be disabled by setting the CDRom Autorun registry value to 0 and also setting the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value to 0xFF. The NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value is directly tied to the Group Policy setting for \"Turn off Autoplay.\"Microsoft Windows fails to properly handle the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value. According to Microsoft's documentation, setting NoDriveTypeAutoRun to 0xFF should disable AutoPlay for all types of drives. However, when this registry value is present, Vista enables some AutoPlay features that may not have been enabled prior to setting that registry value. For example, if NoDriveTypeAutoRun is set to 0xFF, Vista may execute a program specified in the Autorun.inf file when the device icon is clicked. Other values for NoDriveTypeAutoRun may also enable certain AutoPlay features in Vista. For Windows versions older than Vista, the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value is simply ignored with respect to certain AutoRun features. In other words, setting the value will not put the system at additional risk, but will not disable AutoRun completely.",
        "impact": "Microsoft Windows may have some AutoPlay enabled, even though the Group Policy Editor and associated registry values indicate otherwise. This may allow an attacker to cause a user to inadvertently execute arbitrary code on a removable device, such as a USB drive.Certain versions of malicious code called Conficker or Downadup use the AutoRun feature to propagate."

        "description": "In the C language, given the following types: char *buf; int len;some C compilers will assume that buf+len >= buf. As a result, code that performs wrapping checks similar to the following:len = 1<<30;[...]if(buf+len < buf) /* wrap check */ [...overflow occurred...]are optimized out by these compilers; no object code to perform the check will appear in the resulting executable program. In the case where the wrap test expression is optimized out, a subsequent manipulation of len could cause an overflow. As a result, applications that perform such checks may be vulnerable to buffer overflows.Wrapping checks that use methods similar to the one described above depend on undefined behavior. Conforming implementations are permitted to perform the optimization by the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 C specification (§6.5.6p8) as undefined behavior. Even if a conforming implementation currently generates object code for an undefined behavior, future versions of the compiler are not obligated to do the same; this behavior may be viewed as an opportunity for further optimization. To ensure that such changes to the compiler do not invalidate assumptions, developers should follow the recommendations described in CERT C Secure Coding recommendation MSC15-C and rule ARR38-C to avoid this error. Furthermore, compilers are not required to issue diagnostics for undefined behavior, so there is frequently no easy way to identify undefined behavior in code, particularly during manual code audits. Note that this issue does not strictly constitute a vulnerability in the compilers themselves. Rather, this behavior may introduce vulnerabilities in applications that include similar code and are compiled with affected compiler implementations. Existing code that relies on the undefined behavior in the wrapping check is particularly susceptible to this behavior.Multiple implementations are known to perform this optimization. This optimization may be affected by the setting of the optimization level as well as other flags. Additional information about affected implementations can be found in the Systems Affected section of this document.",
        "impact": "An application that performs wrapping checks based on an expression such as the one described above may be vulnerable to buffer overflow if compiled with affected compiler implementations. The nature of the resulting vulnerability would be specific to the application and depends on how the affected code is used."

Loosely, the record partitions all hosts into permitted and not-permitted sets (though some hosts might fall into neither category).libspf2 contins a buffer overflow in DNS TXT record parsing. According to Doxpara Research:DNS TXT records have long been a little tricky to parse, due to them containing two length fields. First, there is the length field of the record as a whole. Then, there is a sublength field, from 0 to 255, that describes the length of a particular character string inside the larger record. There is nothing that links the two values, and DNS servers to not themselves enforce sanity checks here. As such, there is always a risk that when receiving a DNS TXT record, the outer record length will be the amount allocated, but the inner length will be copied.This issue is similar to VU#814627 \"Sendmail vulnerable to buffer overflow when DNS map is specified using TXT records.\"",

Nodes that can send each other NDP messages are considered to be on-link (as per RFC 4861).After receiving a neighbor solicitation request from a system that is on-link and is using a spoofed IPv6 address as the source address, a router will create a neighbor cache entry. When this entry is made, some IPv6 implementations will create a Forwarding Information Base (FIB) entry. This FIB entry may cause the router to incorrectly forward traffic to the device that sent original spoofed neighbor solicitation request. Note that an attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for this vulnerability to be exploited. Although this vulnerability has only a local attack vector (NDP messages are not forwarded by routers), flat IPv6 networks can include many hosts and may cover large geographical distances as compared to IPv4 networks.Similar problems to this issue have been discussed in RFC 3756 \"IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats.\"",

Nodes that can send each other NDP messages are considered to be on-link (as per RFC 4861).After receiving a neighbor solicitation request from a system that is on-link and is using a spoofed IPv6 address as the source address, a router will create a neighbor cache entry. When this entry is made, some IPv6 implementations will create a Forwarding Information Base (FIB) entry. This FIB entry may cause the router to incorrectly forward traffic to the device that sent original spoofed neighbor solicitation request. Note that an attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for this vulnerability to be exploited. Although this vulnerability has only a local attack vector (NDP messages are not forwarded by routers), flat IPv6 networks can include many hosts and may cover large geographical distances as compared to IPv4 networks.Similar problems to this issue have been discussed in RFC 3756 \"IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats.\"",
        "impact": "An attacker may be able to intercept private network traffic. Receiving the traffic may cause links to become congested or saturated due to the additional bandwidth. Administrators are encouraged to read RFC 3756 for more information about other possible vulnerabilities and impacts."

SSH contains a vulnerability in the way certain types of errors are handled. Attacks leveraging this vulnerabilty would lead to the loss of the SSH session. According to CPNI Vulnerability Advisory SSH:If exploited, this attack can potentially allow an attacker to recover up to 32 bits of plaintext from an arbitrary block of ciphertext from a connection secured using the SSH protocol in the standard configuration. If OpenSSH is used in the standard configuration, then the attacker's success probability for recovering 32 bits of plaintext is 2^{-18}.
