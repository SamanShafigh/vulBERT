        "description": "Description of problem:Jake Edge has reported the following gcc kernel related potentialsecurity issue on LWN:<cite>A change to GCC for a recent release coupled with a kernel bug has created amessy situation, with possible security implications. GCC changed someassumptions about x86 processor flags, in accordance with the ABI standard, thatcan lead to memory corruption for programs built with GCC 4.3.0. No one has comeup with a way to exploit the flaw, at least yet, but it clearly is a problemthat needs to be addressed.The problem revolves around the x86 direction flag (DF), which governs whetherblock memory operations operate forward through memory or backwards. The mainuse for the flag is to support overlapping memory copies, where workingbackwards through memory may be required so that the data being copied does notget overwritten as the copy progresses. Debian hacker Aurélien Jarno reportedthe problem to linux-kernel on March 5th, which was found when building SteelBank Common Lisp (SBCL) using the new compiler.GCC's most recent release, 4.3.0, assumes that the direction flag has beencleared (i.e. memory operations go in a forward direction) at the entry of eachfunction, as is specified by the ABI (which is, somewhat amusingly, found atsco.com [PDF]). Unfortunately, this clashes with Linux signal handlers, whichget called, incorrectly, with the flag in whatever state it was in when thesignal occurred. This has the effect of leaking one bit of state from the userspace process that was running when the signal occurred to the signal handler,which could be in another process.That, in itself, is a bug, seemingly with fairly minimal impact. Prior to 4.3,GCC would emit a cld (clear direction flag) opcode before doing inline string ormemory operations, so those operations would start from a known state. In 4.3,GCC relies on the ABI mandate that the direction flag is cleared before entry toa function, which means that the kernel needs to arrange that before calling asignal handler. It currently doesn't, but a small patch fixes that.The window of vulnerability is small, but was observed in SBCL. The sequence ofevents that would lead to memory corruption are as follows: * a user space program does an operation (memmove() for example) that sets DF * a signal occurs for some process * the kernel calls the signal handler * the signal handler does a memmove() in what it thinks is a forward direction * the memory is copied in the reverse direction, leading to corruption</cite>Link to the post:http://lwn.net/Articles/272048/#CommentsLink to upstream fix:http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git;a=commitdiff;h=52c841e1012b8e73cc04b53f92fb933db580fb42"

The vulnerability is an integer overflow whichleads to a kmalloc() for 0 bytes, followed by a memory copy into the returnedpointer for 255 bytes, which causes a heap overflow. This type of vulnerabilitycan be exploited by a local attacker to gain arbitrary code execution.Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):2.6.17 <= x <= 2.6.20 (See the timeline for more details)Additional information:This vulnerability affects the dccp kernel module (shipped as part of theRHEL kernel updates)."

In some cases the ciphersuite can be downgraded to a weaker one on subsequent connections.Problem affects SSL/TLS server that enable workaround for old Netscape server SSL implementation bug - SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG. An attacker able to sniff session identifier (sent in plain during the SSL handshake) could use this flaw to force change of the cipher suite in stored session. Client, that later resumes that session, may start using different (weaker) cipher suite chosen by attacker.OpenSSL upstream version enable SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG when SSL_OP_ALL option is set (it's common to set this option in applications using OpenSSL). However, OpenSSL versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 have SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG excluded from SSL_OP_ALL (the change was done in response to bug #175779). Applications can enable Netscape bug workaround on those versions explicitly.OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.8j allowed attacker to change stored session cipher quite to arbitrary cipher suite supported by OpenSSL. Version 0.9.8j corrected this issue to only allow changing cipher suite to those server is configured to use: http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17489In both cases, client must accept cipher suite change on resume for the downgrade attack to succeed.Issue was addressed upstream in 0.9.8q and 1.0.0c by completely disabling this obsolete bug workaround: http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=20131"
