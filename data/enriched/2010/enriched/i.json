We fixed that in commit e76b2b2567b83448c2ee85a896433b96150c92e6 (\"[IPV6]: Do no rely on skb->dst before it is assigned.\")However commit 483a47d2fe794328d29950fe00ce26dd405d9437 (\"ipv6: added net argument to IP6_INC_STATS_BH\") put a new version of the same bug into this function.Complicating analysis further, this bug can only trigger when network namespaces are enabled in the build. When namespaces are turned off, the dev_net() does not evaluate it's argument, so the dereference would not occur.So, for a long time, namespaces couldn't be turned on unless SYSFS was disabled. Therefore, this code has largely been disabled except by people turning it on explicitly for namespace development.With help from Eugene Teo <eugene@redhat.com>Signed-off-by: David S.

Configure an SSSD system to authenticate against a Kerberos KDC2. Log in as a user while SSSD is online.3. Verify that the user has a valid TGT for the Kerberos realm.4. Unplug the network cable.5. Lock the display.6. The user will be able to unlock the display with any password. Additionally, this can make a system network-vulnerable, as if the SSSD is in the offline state (either the KDC or the identity server is unreachable), an attacker can log into any account that has a valid TGT.Actual results:Passwords are not properly verified against the cached credentials. Any password will be treated as a valid authentication.Expected results:Authentication should succeed with only the valid credentials.Additional info:The only current workaround for this problem is to disable Kerberos authentication on affected machines until a patched binary is available."

The bug is in x86 emulator code. When emulator accesses guest's memory on behalf of the gust's code it does this with the CPL0 privilege, so if emulated instruction is executed by unprivileged code it can still modify memory that otherwise is not accessible to it. To tak advantage of this vulnerability malicious code should trick KVM to emulate malicious instruction.

For kqueue and epoll implementations, cupsdRemoveSelect() does not immediately decrease the reference count for the file descriptor and instead adds it to the cupsd_inactive_fds array. File descriptors in that array are finally dereferenced in cupsdStopSelect() (i.e. program termination).In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the epoll implementation is used.The previous fix for CVE-2009-3553 was to check that another reference was held for the file descriptor before calling the write_cb function; however, that will always be the case for both the epoll and kqueue implementations.The correct fix is to check whether the file descriptor is in the cupsd_inactive_fds array before calling the write_cb function."

Getting it is not used, let's drop support for notifications about (un)registered events from connector. Another option was to check credentials on receiving, but we can always restore it without bugs if needed, but genetlink has a wider code base and none complained, that userspace can not get notification when some other clients were (un)registered.

However it introduced other problems.In the likely case, when rbs_child == child, ptrace_check_attach() is never called. Otherwise we do ptrace_check_attach(rbs_child) twice. This means that any peek/poke request can silently fail and fool the tracer.With this patch the logic isptrace_check_attach(child);if (rbs_child != child) {// we should use rbs_child ...if (!ptrace_check_attach(rbs_child))child = rbs_child;// but if check_attach() fails we continue to// use child, we are doing as well as we can.}To simplify the error-handling and the logic, this patch changes the code to detect the likely rbs_child == child case earlier, right after find_thread_for_addr().This only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4."

        "description": "Description Tomas Hoger 2010-03-12 16:16:28 UTC During the testing of GnuTLS updates, a flaw was discovered affecting Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 GnuTLS packages on s390x platform, causing gnutls-cli to crash while printing server certificate info.This crash was caused by a flaw in gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial(), which calls asn1_read_value() to extract serial number from the x509 certificate.(lib/x509/x509.c) 526 int gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial(gnutls_x509_crt cert, void* result, 527 size_t* result_size) 528 { ... 536 if ((ret = asn1_read_value(cert->cert, \"tbsCertificate.serialNumber\", result, result_size)) < 0) {asn1_read_value() expects pointer to int (32 bit) as its third argument, but gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial() passed pointer to size_t (64 bit on 64 bit platforms) instead. On 64bit big endian platforms asn1_read_value() got incorrect length value.(lib/minitasn1/element.c) 598 asn1_retCode 599 asn1_read_value(node_asn *root,const char *name,void* ivalue, int *len)On little endian 64 bit platforms, high 32 bits of the *result_size size_t value were lost, but they only contained zeros. On big endian 64 bit platforms, low 32 bits were lost / ignored, causing asn1_read_value() to see length value as 0. This caused asn1_read_value() to return an error, but the length of the value that should have been extracted was saved to *len.gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial() did not correctly check return value of asn1_read_value(), failing to detect an error. After returning, caller could see a high value stored in *result_size (when interpreted as 64 bit value again).print_x509_info() (used by gnutls-cli or gnutls-serv) and print_certificate_info() (used by certtool) relied on the returned size value. Unexpected value caused a stack buffer overflow in those functions.This bug could also cause gnutls_x509_crt_check_revocation() to incorrectly check supplied X509 certificate against the list of revoked certificates, resulting in a bypass or the CRL check.This issue was fixed upstream via following commit: http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gnutls.git/commit/?id=112d537dThis fix was first included in upstream version 1.2.1. Therefore, GnuTLS packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Fedora, and current upstream GnuTLS versions are not affected by this flaw."

If a local user would firstlocally create a symbolic link, which target would pointto some system sensitive file / directory and link nameof this link would be placed into an exported Samba share,with write access for Samba users, this might allow a remoteattacker to read, list and retrieve files, behind the targetof the symbolic link.Samba upstream review of reasons and impact of this issue: [4] http://marc.info/?l=samba-technical&m=126539387432412&w=2As mentioned in [4] the problem \"is actually a default insecureconfiguration in Samba.\" and \"comes from a combination of two features in Samba, each of which on their own are useful toAdministrators\". Workaround -- to prevent occurrence of this deficiency set:===========================================================wide links = noin the [global] section of your smb.conf and restart theSamba (smbd) daemon. This will ensure, remote Samba clientswill not follow symbolink links, exported in Samba shares,to their target anymore (thus prevent the potential disclosureof sensitive data)."

        "description": "Description Eugene Teo (Security Response) 2010-04-22 05:39:14 UTC Description of problem:Reported by Nokia-CN-Flexi via Issue Tracker. A similar issue was reported by Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva from the CROSS open source testing project at Codenomicon Ltd. This was also reported by Windriver on behalf of their customer via vendor-sec.Kernel crash occurs if sctp listening port receives malformatted init packet.Its an skb_over_panic BUG halt that results from processing an init chunk in which too many of its variable length parameters are in some way malformed.The problem is in sctp_process_unk_param:if (NULL == *errp)*errp = sctp_make_op_error_space(asoc, chunk, ntohs(chunk->chunk_hdr->length));if (*errp) {sctp_init_cause(*errp, SCTP_ERROR_UNKNOWN_PARAM, WORD_ROUND(ntohs(param.p->length)));sctp_addto_chunk(*errp,WORD_ROUND(ntohs(param.p->length)), param.v);When we allocate an error chunk, we assume that the worst case scenario requires that we have chunk_hdr->length data allocated, which would be correct nominally,given that we call sctp_addto_chunk for the violating parameter. Unfortunately,we also, in sctp_init_cause insert a sctp_errhdr_t structure into the errorchunk, so the worst case situation in which all parameters are in violationrequires chunk_hdr->length+(sizeof(sctp_errhdr_t)*param_count) bytes of data.This fix solves the problem by allowing our implementation to only report afixed number of errors. When we encounter an error in parameter processing weallocate a chunk that is min(asoc->pathmtu, SCTP_DEFAULT_MAXSEGMENT), limitingour error reporting to a single mtu sized chunk. Parameter errors that growbeyond that value are discarded.Acknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva of Codenomicon Ltd, Nokia Siemens Networks, and Wind River on behalf of their customer, for reporting this issue."

There is nothing stopping aclient from trying to send such a message however, and if that happens, weattempt to dereference tipc_net.zones while the pointer is still NULL, andexplode. The fix is pretty straightforward. Since these oopses all arise fromthe dereference of global pointers prior to their assignment to allocatedvalues, and since these allocations are small (about 2k total), lets convertthese pointers to static arrays of the appropriate size. All the accesses tothese bits consider 0/NULL to be a non match when searching, so all the lookupsstill work properly, and there is no longer a chance of a bad dererenceanywhere. As a bonus, this lets us eliminate the setup/teardown routines forthose pointers, and elimnates the need to preform any locking around them toprevent access while their being allocated/freed.http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=commit;h=d0021b252eaf65ca07ed14f0d66425dd9ccab9a6"

When sudo set certain environment variables (such as PATH set to secure_path value, or special sudo environment variables SUDO_*), the value overwrote first value from user's environment (if it had been preserved and had not removed previously due to env_reset / env_keep / env_delete settings), but left following environment variables with the same name unchanged.This problem can be used to override secure_path setting from /etc/sudoers file for shell scripts executed using sudo, as bash uses last PATH environment variable value. In configurations where secure_path is used to enforce sane PATH setting for shell scripts, this can allow users with the privileges to run some script using sudo to run arbitrary command with the privileges of the target user.Upstream fixes to handle duplicated environment variables: http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/3057fde43cf0 http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/a09c6812eaecThis issue affects sudo packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, however not the default configuration. In default configuration, no secure_path is set. env_reset is used by default, and PATH is not preserved during the environment reset (unlike the upstream sudo default).The sudo packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 do not allow setting secure_path in the /etc/sudoers, there is no compile-time default for the secure_path either. Whether the user PATH setting is preserved depends on env_reset / env_delete configuration.Current Fedora configuration specifies secure_path, but also removes PATH from the environment by default."

What is missing is add a message authentication code (MAC) to the encryption to prevent padding oracle attack. The objective is detect if the received view state has been modified and do not process it, throwing ViewExpiredException.The problem can be solved if users change to server side state saving, because on the view state only a identifier is sent and no changes on the component tree could be done with this configuration.The proposed solution was add this new web-config params:org.apache.myfaces.MAC_ALGORITHM : Indicate the algorithm used to calculate the Message Authentication Code that is added to the view state.org.apache.myfaces.MAC_SECRET : Define the initialization code that are used to initialize the secret key used on the Message Authentication Code algorithm.org.apache.myfaces.MAC_SECRET.CACHE : If is set to \"false\", the secret key used for MAC algorithm is not cached. This is used when the returned SecretKey for mac algorithm is not thread safe.It was unified security configuration in all branches to works the same. That means, it was included in 1.1.x the property org.apache.myfaces.USE_ENCRYPTION.Now, if an error occur when the state is encrypted/decrypted, a ViewExpiredException is thrown, but the real exception is logged, to hide information that could be useful to non developers.This was corrected upstream in versions 1.1.8, 1.2.9, and 2.0.1.

One example is with standard NFS exports now being accessible to the guests, because the guests will appear to be from the same IP as a possibly trusted host.To illustrate:regular-user@host-machine:~$ ssh guest-machineLast login: Wed Jun 9 11:33:13 2010 from host-machineregular-user@guest-machine:~$ sudo mount -t nfs -o udp,rw,softremote-nfs-server:/some-export /mnt/tmp(get UID of resources on the remote NFS server, and create a user in theguest with that UID>(su to that new UID)user-with-same-uid@guest-machine:~$ cp -R /mnt/tmp/secret-data /home/mycopy; rm -Rf /mnt/tmp/secret-dataA normal user account would not normally be able to do something like this because they cannot bind to the privileged port, however in this case the NAT rules permits it.An example modified set of iptables rules that may solve the problem was supplied as well:/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -o $(IFACE) -j MASQUERADE --to-ports 1024-65535/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p udp -o $(IFACE) -j MASQUERADE --to-ports 1024-65535/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p icmp -o $(IFACE) -j MASQUERADEThe above uses the --to-ports option that forces iptables' masquerading module to only map guest reqursts to non-privileged ports.Acknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Nickurak for reporting this issue."

It probably requires some upstream review as it does add a new configuration option:http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2908However, Ludwig Nussel indicates that wget's behaviour is acceptable and probably doesn't require fixing at all, as wget does not overwrite existing files by default (adds suffixes like .1 and .2 to the new file if it already exists), and also prints the file name it used so there are no surprises.In light of that, I would consider this a non-issue for wget, especially considering how intrusive the patch is for a backport."

So subsequent calls to READ_BUF will think there is much more than a page of spare space (the cast to u32 ensures an unsigned comparison) so we can expect to fall off the end of the second page. We never encountered this in testing because typically the only operations which use more than two pages are write-like operations, which have their own decoding logic. Something like a getattr after a write may cross a page boundary, but it would be very unusual for it to cross another boundary after that.Upstream commit:http://git.kernel.org/linus/2bc3c1179c781b359d4f2f3439cb3df72afc17fc"

        "title": "CVE-2010-2526 lvm2-cluster: insecurity when communicating between lvm2 and clvmd",
        "description": "Description Vincent Danen 2010-07-13 22:55:32 UTC During some routine code review last week, Alasdair Kergon spotted a security flaw in the clustered LVM daemon, clvmd. The report from him is as follows:Clvmd, a privileged process, accepts, acts upon and responds to communications from unprivileged processes.Background information======================clvmd belongs to the lvm2-cluster package and as such is normally used in shared storage clusters, where several machines are using the same disks in parallel. It is run on every machine in such a cluster. The daemon has to be enabled explictly after installing the package: it does not run by default (since RHEL4.5). Systems not running the daemon i.e. most LVM systems, not subscribed to RHN clustering channels, are not vulnerable.Clvmd has three roles that require root privilege:(1) Communicate with clvmd processes on other machines;(2) Hold locks to ensure conflicting commands are not run in parallel;(3) Make Logical Volumes available for use on the local machine by issuing the appropriate device-mapper ioctls to the kernel.When a LVM command is issued in a cluster, an instruction is sent to the local clvmd to obtain the necessary locks and to activate or deactivate logical volumes. Any changes to the on-disk LVM metadata are performed by the original LVM process - not by clvmd itself - and then the instance of clvmd on each machine reads the updated metadata independently from disk.The flaw========The problem was caused by an upstream commit made in April 2004. Prior to that, the communication between lvm and clvmd was through a socket in the filesystem, so it was protected by standard file-system security mechanisms. The commit in question changed it to use an abstract socket starting with a NUL byte (see 'man 7 unix') but no attempt was made to secure it by exchanging credentials. Consequently an unprivileged process can instruct clvmd to perform operations that were supposed to be available only to root.Operations available to an attacker:(1) Instruct clvmd to suspend the use of any Logical Volume visible to any machine in the cluster with immediate effect.(2) Instruct clvmd to activate, deactivate or reload any Logical Volume visible to any machine in the cluster. (Deactivation will fail if the Logical Volume is in use.)(3) Instruct clvmd to die.(4) Instruct clvmd to restart (versions 2.02.64 and later).(5) Instruct clvmd to obtain, release or report the state of locks held by the daemon.(6) Enable/disable clvmd's debugging mode which controls the amount of detail it logs.(7) Instruct clvmd to create a backup of a Volume Group's metadata on all the other nodes.(8) Instruct clvmd to report the cluster name.(9) Instruct clvmd to echo back the command it received.(10) Instruct clvmd to refresh its internal caches.Several of these involve performing privileged operations and could impact upon service availability on machines belonging to the cluster.The fix=======We are reverting to using a pathname for the socket and relying upon standard filesystem security."

        "description": "Description Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala 2010-12-30 05:46:46 UTC An integer overflow vulnerability was found in the parser for TFM font files, which are used for rendering DVI files, in the GNOME evince document viewer that can lead to local or remote code execution. Due to insufficient checks on the value of an integer used as the size for a memory allocation, it's possible to write data beyond the bounds of the allocated memory and overwrite a function pointer, leading to code execution.Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier CVE-2010-2643 tothis issue.The vulnerability is present in the code that handles loading of fonts used byDVI files.To exploit you need two files, a DVI file and the malicious font.The vulnerability is triggered not only by opening the document in evince, butalso by browsing to a folder which contains the malicious files, where evincethumbnailer will load the malicious file to generate a thumbnail for it.Acknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the original reporter."

        "description": "Description Eugene Teo (Security Response) 2010-08-02 03:03:06 UTC Description of problem:The problem was in the way the gfs2 directory code was trying to re-use sentinel directory entries.In the failing case, gfs2's rename function was renaming a file to another name that had the same non-trivial length. The file being renamed happened to be the first directory entry on the leaf block.First, the rename code (gfs2_rename in ops_inode.c) found the original directory entry and decided it could do its job by simply replacing the directory entry with another. Therefore it determined correctly that no block allocations were needed.Next, the rename code deleted the old directory entry prior to replacing it with the new name. Therefore, the soon-to-be replaced directory entry was temporarily made into a directory entry \"sentinel\" or a place holder at the start of a leaf block.Lastly, it went to re-add the replacement directory entry in that leaf block. However, when gfs2_dirent_find_space was looking for space in the leaf block, it used the wrong value for the sentinel. That threw off its calculations so later it decides it can't really re-use the sentinel and therefore must allocate a new leaf block. But because it previously decided to re-use the directory entry, it didn't waste the time to grab a new block allocation for the inode. Therefore, the inode's i_alloc pointer was still NULL and it crashes trying to reference it.In the case of sentinel directory entries, the entire dirent is reused, not just the \"free space\" portion of it, and therefore the function gfs2_dirent_find_space should use the value 0 rather than GFS2_DIRENT_SIZE(0) for the actual dirent size.Fixing this calculation enables the reproducer programs to work properly."

        "description": "Description Eugene Teo (Security Response) 2010-08-18 05:44:36 UTC Description of problem:This series closes a recently discovered problem in XFS filehandle conversion.On systems where inodes are dynamically deleted, XFS does not adequately verifythe inode numbers in the filehandles, which results in reading stale inodesfrom disk and potentially returning them as valid files. Because these unlinkedinodes were never zeroed out when the chunk was deallocated, some inodes in thechunk can still appear to have to data extents attached to them. This can leadto stale data exposure, exposure of active data and potentially overwriting ofactive data if the stale extents referenced in the unlinked inodes have beenre-allocated.Both NFS filehandles and local filehandles provided through libhandle have thissame problem. libhandle requires root permissions to use the interface, so itis not exposing information that you can't get more easily with other means(e.g. xfs_db or reading directly form the block device), so there isn't reallyan issue here.For NFS, we may incorrectly accept stale file handles for unlinked inodes aftera server reboot if the unlinked inodes have not been overwritten leading to theabove issues being triggered if multiple NFS clients are accessing the samefiles.Christoph's make-bulkstat-coherent patch is the basis for this series asbulkstat can also expose unlinked inodes and information about them back touserspace as it makes the same assumptions about inode lookups as the filehandle interfaces.As a result, the first two patches of the series make up the real bug fix. Thelast two patches make it clear we are lookuping up untrusted inode numbers andclear away a shortcut that these interfaces used that we do not want used anymore. Hence for backports to other kernels, only the first two patches arenecessary.The test program that demonstrates the issue via the open_by_handle interfacecan be found here:http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2010-06/msg00191.htmlVersion 2:- removed useless ip->i_imap.im_blkno initialisation in xfs_iread()- reworked a comment refering to bulkstat when it should refer to untrusted inodes.- removed typedefs from xfs_imap_lookup()- killed useless error logging from xfs_imap_lookup()- rearranged the logic flow of xfs_imap_lookup() to remove the gotos.[PATCH 0/4, V2] xfs: validate inode numbers in file handles correctlyhttp://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.xfs.general/33767[PATCH 1/4] xfs: always use iget in bulkstathttp://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.xfs.general/33770[PATCH 2/4] xfs: validate untrusted inode numbers during lookuphttp://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.xfs.general/33771[PATCH 3/4] xfs: rename XFS_IGET_BULKSTAT to XFS_IGET_UNTRUSTEDhttp://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.xfs.general/33768[PATCH 4/4] xfs: remove block number from inode lookup codehttp://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.xfs.general/33769[PATCH] xfsqa: test open_by_handle() on unlinked and freed inode clusterhttp://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2010-06/msg00191.html"

Previous Django releasesprovided a different, optionally-enabled system for the same purpose.The Django 1.2 CSRF protection system involves the generation of a randomtoken, inserted as a hidden field in outgoing forms. The same value is alsoset in a cookie, and the cookie value and form value are compared onsubmission.The provided template tag for inserting the CSRF token into forms -- {%csrf_token %} -- explicitly trusts the cookie value, and displays it as-is.Thus, an attacker who is able to tamper with the value of the CSRF cookiecan cause arbitrary content to be inserted, unescaped, into the outgoingHTML of the form, enabling cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.This issue was first reported via a public ticket in Django's Tracinstance; while being triaged it was then independently reported, withbroader description, by Jeff Balogh of Mozilla.http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2010/sep/08/security-release/"

Thevulnerability is caused by the MPlayer's flic codec (flicvideo.c) on 8 bitsper pixel videos because the codec does not check received values. This couldbe exploited jumping to arbitrary code by opening a specially crafted file.\"They were particularly concerned about the ffmpeg inclusion in mplayer. The affected file (flicvideo.c) is also present in libextractor as provided by Fedora 12. It looks as though the only thing using libextractor in Fedora is doodle (local search program, like Spotlight). This would mean a user would have to download a specially crafted file and store it locally, and be using doodle to index files. I don't know whether or not doodle would be problematic here, i.e. if it's just reading metadata it might not cause any problems at all.Later versions of libextractor have removed the embedded ffmpeg sources."

If CONFIG_ECONET_AUNUDP, the function declares a variable-length array of iovec'son the stack:static int econet_sendmsg(struct kiocb *iocb, struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, size_t len){ ...#ifdef CONFIG_ECONET_AUNUDP...struct iovec iov[msg->msg_iovlen+1];...#endif\"msg->msg_iovlen\" is a user-controlled value <= 1024; 1024 'struct iovec's isenough to overflow the kernel stack and clobber the 'thread_info' struct oneither 32- or 64-bit systems with or without CONFIG_4KSTACKS.The code populates 'iov' with user-controlled values, so this is almostcertainly exploitable for privesc.The second bug is conveniently labeled as such for anyone who cares to look:/* BUG: saddr may be NULL */eb->cookie = saddr->cookie;In fact, 'saddr' comes from userspace and may be NULL (if non-NULL, it will havebeen copied to kernelspace), leading to a NULL-pointer dereference. Thissaddr->cookie dereference appears twice, once in the \"hardware\" case and once inthe \"UDP emulation\" case. This is easily exploitable for an oops, but probablynot anything more.The final issue is in the ec_dev_ioctl function. The SIOCSIFADDR ioctl does notcheck privileges, allowing an unprivileged user to assign econet addresses toarbitrary interfaces. It is possible this is intentional, but AFAIK it would beunusual for SIOCSIFADDR to be unprivileged, so this may be an accident.Note that it is necessary to use this property in order to make the first twobugs exploitable, since econet_sendmsg will return almost immediately if noeconet addresses are configured.Reference:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2010/q4/236"

If CONFIG_ECONET_AUNUDP, the function declares a variable-length array of iovec'son the stack:static int econet_sendmsg(struct kiocb *iocb, struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, size_t len){ ...#ifdef CONFIG_ECONET_AUNUDP...struct iovec iov[msg->msg_iovlen+1];...#endif\"msg->msg_iovlen\" is a user-controlled value <= 1024; 1024 'struct iovec's isenough to overflow the kernel stack and clobber the 'thread_info' struct oneither 32- or 64-bit systems with or without CONFIG_4KSTACKS.The code populates 'iov' with user-controlled values, so this is almostcertainly exploitable for privesc.The second bug is conveniently labeled as such for anyone who cares to look:/* BUG: saddr may be NULL */eb->cookie = saddr->cookie;In fact, 'saddr' comes from userspace and may be NULL (if non-NULL, it will havebeen copied to kernelspace), leading to a NULL-pointer dereference. Thissaddr->cookie dereference appears twice, once in the \"hardware\" case and once inthe \"UDP emulation\" case. This is easily exploitable for an oops, but probablynot anything more.The final issue is in the ec_dev_ioctl function. The SIOCSIFADDR ioctl does notcheck privileges, allowing an unprivileged user to assign econet addresses toarbitrary interfaces. It is possible this is intentional, but AFAIK it would beunusual for SIOCSIFADDR to be unprivileged, so this may be an accident.Note that it is necessary to use this property in order to make the first twobugs exploitable, since econet_sendmsg will return almost immediately if noeconet addresses are configured.Reference:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2010/q4/236"

This is a reasonable design, in order to be loaded a system administrator must brand a library as safe before it will be loaded across privilege boundaries. This allows developers who design their programs to operate safely while running as setuid are able to do so. The same conditions do not apply to LD_AUDIT, which will load an arbitrary DSOs, regardless of whether it has been designed to operate safely or not.Tavis found out that by exploiting unsafely designed DSO constructors intrusted directories it is possible to achieve privilege escalation.Acknowledgements:Red Hat would like to thank Ben Hawkes and Tavis Ormandy for reporting this issue."

As longas this connection is open, no clients can connect to the bisocket control portbecause the connections are not accepted at server side.The cause of this vulnerability is found in methodorg.jboss.remoting.transport.bisocket.BisocketServerInvoker$SecondaryServerSocketThread.run(),which contains the accept-loop for the bisocket control connection. Afterhaving accepted a connection, the accept loop thread reads from the newlycreated connection expecting the client to send an action code and a listenerid. If the client sends nothing, the accept loop thread will block in the readcall, causing no other connections to be accepted.To fix, the accept loop thread should not do the read on the new connection.Instead it should start a new thread that does the read."

What is missing is add a message authentication code (MAC) to the encryption to prevent padding oracle attack. The objective is detect if the received view state has been modified and do not process it, throwing ViewExpiredException.The problem can be solved if users change to server side state saving, because on the view state only a identifier is sent and no changes on the component tree could be done with this configuration.The proposed solution was add this new web-config params:org.apache.myfaces.MAC_ALGORITHM : Indicate the algorithm used to calculate the Message Authentication Code that is added to the view state.org.apache.myfaces.MAC_SECRET : Define the initialization code that are used to initialize the secret key used on the Message Authentication Code algorithm.org.apache.myfaces.MAC_SECRET.CACHE : If is set to \"false\", the secret key used for MAC algorithm is not cached. This is used when the returned SecretKey for mac algorithm is not thread safe.It was unified security configuration in all branches to works the same. That means, it was included in 1.1.x the property org.apache.myfaces.USE_ENCRYPTION.Now, if an error occur when the state is encrypted/decrypted, a ViewExpiredException is thrown, but the real exception is logged, to hide information that could be useful to non developers.This was corrected upstream in versions 1.1.8, 1.2.9, and 2.0.1.

Regular expression matching function is called recursively for certain types of patterns (where subexpression using quantifier is nested inside of another quantified expression), where long input can result in deep recursion and exhaustion of all stack memory (i.e. impact is limited to crash). Amount of stack memory availableto glibc regular expression engine influences the size of input that must be provided to trigger the crash. Alternatively, expression can be modified to avoid quantification nesting, or program modified to limit size of input passed to regularexpression engine.Conclusion: Due the above described behavior Red Hat SecurityResponse Team would not classify this deficiency to be a securityissue.References:[1] http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/912279[2] http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/515589[3] http://forums.cnet.com/7726-6132_102-5042238.html[4] http://secunia.com/advisories/42547/[5] http://securityreason.com/securityalert/8003"

This configuration facilitated a trust relationship between cumin and the condor-qmf plugins. However, there was inadequate access control for securing the trusted channel; anyone able to publish to a broker could submit jobs. As well, this meant that a user could submit a job to run as any other user other than root (Condor does not run jobs as root).In a future update, through enhancements to the QMF Agent, access control on the condor-qmf plugins is adequate to secure the trust relationship."

Hence an attacker could use this implementation flaw to successfully authenticate (i.e. prove knowledge of the shared secret) to the peer, usually server.Sébastien Martini paper describing this flaw, as well as proof of concept code can be found in the following github repository: https://github.com/seb-m/jpakeOpenSSL upstream fix for the issue, which should be included in version 0.9.8q and 1.0.0c: http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=20098Note: J-PAKE implementation is considered experimental upstream and is not enabled by default."

        "description": "Description Fabio Olive Leite 2015-05-04 14:13:08 UTC This flaw was fixed upstream back in 2010, without much attention beinggiven to the possible security implications of it. It is a remote bufferoverflow with possibility of executing arbitrary code, with only a fewrestrictions, such as having the cups service open to the network and aparticular kind of filter in use.Analysis by Engineering shows that only RHEL-6 contains the affected code,so RHEL-5, RHEL-7 and Fedora are not affected. Giving this flaw a Moderaterating, despite the 7.7 CVSSv2 score, as cups is not usually configuredwidely open to the network or internet at large, and because it depends ona particular kind of filter being used.References:https://bugs.linuxfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=515"

        "description": "Description Adam Mariš 2016-07-21 15:11:27 UTC A process that is in the same process group as the ``init'' process (group id zero) can crash the Linux kernel with several system calls by passing in a process ID or process group ID of zero. The value zero is a special value that indicates the current process ID or process group. However, in this case it is also the process group ID of the process.Upstream fixes:https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f106eee10038c2ee5b6056aaf3f6d5229be6dcddhttps://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f20011457f41c11edb5ea5038ad0c8ea9f392023https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=fa2755e20ab0c7215d99c2dc7c262e98a09b01df"
