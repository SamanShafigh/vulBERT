In particular do_each_pid_task(init_struct_pid) shouldn't see swapper. This is the actual reason why kill(0, SIGKILL) from /sbin/init (which starts with 0,0 special pids) crashes the kernel. The signal sent to pgid/sid == 0 must never see idle threads, even if the previous patch fixed the crash itself.- we have other idle threads running on the non-boot CPUs, see the next patch.Change INIT_STRUCT_PID/INIT_PID_LINK to create the empty/unhashedhlist_head/hlist_node. Like any other idle thread swapper can never exit,so detach_pid()->__hlist_del() is not possible, but we could changeINIT_PID_LINK() to set pprev = &next if needed.All we need is the valid swapper->pids[].pid == &init_struct_pid.Reported-by: Mathias Krause <mathias.krause@secunet.com>Signed-off-by: Oleg Nesterov <oleg@redhat.com>Cc: Cedric Le Goater <clg@fr.ibm.com>Cc: Dave Hansen <haveblue@us.ibm.com>Cc: Eric Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>Cc: Herbert Poetzl <herbert@13thfloor.at>Cc: Mathias Krause <Mathias.Krause@secunet.com>Acked-by: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>Acked-by: Serge Hallyn <serue@us.ibm.com>Cc: Sukadev Bhattiprolu <sukadev@us.ibm.com>Signed-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>"
