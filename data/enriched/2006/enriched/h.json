Recent research has uncovered insecure configurations within user accounts and groups on Microsoft Windows systems.

This includes the executable that services launches and the user account with which a service runs as. According to Microsoft, \"Because this grants the caller the right to change the executable file that the system runs, it should be granted only to administrators.\" The SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS access right allows a user full control over a service. Files and DirectoriesAny privileges that allow the contents of a file or a directory to be modified should be granted to only trusted users. The following access rights a of particular concern:The FILE_ALL_ACCESS access right allows a user to completely control a file, including read, write and execute privileges.The FILE_APPEND_DATA access right allows a user to add data to a file.The FILE_WRITE_DATA access right allows a user to write and rewrite data to a file.Registry KeysUsers with KEY_SET_VALUE permissions can modify registry keys that specify executables, DLLs, and/or Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs).The WRITE_DAC access right provides the ability to modify the access control list for a resource.
