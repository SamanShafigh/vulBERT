For signatures with a small exponent such as 3 it is possible for an attacker to calculate a value for this extra data to make an altered message appear to be correctly signed, allowing the signature to be forged. Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS) library was vulnerable to this flaw. Because the set of root Certificate Authorities that ship with Mozilla clients contain some with an exponent of 3 it was possible to make up certificates, such as SSL/TLS and email certificates, that were not detected as invalid. This raised the possibility of the sort of Man-in-the-Middle attacks SSL/TLS was invented to prevent.

Similar in effect to MFSA 2005-51. Workaround The victim site must first be opened in a new window (or tab) by the malicious site for this flaw to work. Do not enter a password or other sensitive information into a window \"helpfully\" opened by another site, always use the File menu option to open a trusted new window to which no other site has a reference."

        "description": "Shutdown demonstrated that it was possible to use a JavaScript watch() to gain elevated privilege. This could be used to compromise the user's computer and install malware. Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in mail. Workaround Upgrade to the fixed versions. Do not enable JavaScript in Thunderbird or the mail portion of SeaMonkey."

This flaw was introduced in the Firefox 1.5.0.4 release, prior versions are unaffected. Mozilla would like to thank an anonymous researcher working with TippingPoint and the Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue. Workaround Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a fixed version."
