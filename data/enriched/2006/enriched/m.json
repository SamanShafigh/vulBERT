Vulnerability Details Script Error Handling Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5579: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer due to attempts to access previously freed memory when handling script errors in certain situations. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. If a user viewed the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. Mitigating Factors for Script Error Handling Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5579: In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems, Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition, and Windows Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista are not affected by this vulnerability.Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 is not affected by this vulnerability. Workarounds for Script Error Handling Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5579: Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section. Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zoneYou can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.Click the Security tab.Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.Note Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in \"Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone”.Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneAfter you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.To do this, follow these steps:In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are \"*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com\" and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zonesYou can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround.

TIF Folder Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5578 An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer in the way that drag and drop operations are handled in certain situations. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could allow for information disclosure if a user viewed and interacted with the Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to retrieve files from the Temporary Internet Files (TIF) folder on a user’s system. Mitigating Factors for TIF Folder Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5578: User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems, Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition, and Windows Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista are not affected by this vulnerability. Workarounds for TIF Folder Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5578: Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

To do this, follow these steps:In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.Click the Security tab.Click Internet, and then click Custom Level.Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.Click Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.Under Settings, in the Scripting section, under Active Scripting, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.Click OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.Note Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in \"Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone”.Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneAfter you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.To do this, follow these steps:In Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.In the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.Click OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.Note Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are \"*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com\" and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zonesYou can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.Under Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.Note If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.Note Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.Impact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality.

Notes When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994. For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the Microsoft TechNet Web site. For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684. Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site. File Version Verification Note Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps. Click Start, and then click Search.In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.In the All or part of the file name box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click Search.In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click Properties.Note Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.On the Version tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.Note Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation. Registry Key Verification You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys. Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Updates\\Windows XP\\SP3\\KB925454\\Filelist Windows XP Professional x64 Edition: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Updates\\Windows XP Version 2003\\SP2\\KB925454\\Filelist Note These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files.

Notes When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994. For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the Microsoft TechNet Web site. For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684. Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site. File Version Verification Note Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps. Click Start, and then click Search.In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.In the All or part of the file name box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click Search.In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click Properties.Note Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.On the Version tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.Note Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation. Registry Key Verification You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key.

Systems Management Server: Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site. SMS 2.0 users can also use Software Updates Service Feature Pack to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the SMS Web site. Note SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following Web site. Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack and in the SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack) to install these updates.
