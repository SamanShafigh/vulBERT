Priit Laes reported this vulnerability.A regular expression that ends with a backslash inside of an unterminated character set (e.g. \"[\\\\\") can trigger an overflow [CVE-2006-4566]. CanadianGuy, Girts Folkmanis, and Catalin Patulea reported this vulnerability. Timing-dependent Javascript cases can trigger this flaw [CVE-2006-4253]. Jonathan Watt and Michal Zalewski independently reported this vulnerability.Various cases can trigger memory corruption, which may potentially lead to arbitrary code execution [CVE-2006-4571]. Bernd Mielke, Georgi Guninski, Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren, Olli Pettay, shutdown, and Weston Carloss reported these vulnerabilities.These vulnerabilities can be exploited only if Javascript is enabled [not the default configuration].",
