        "title": "Loading privileged content through Reader mode",
        "description": "Security researcher Armin Razmdjou reported a flaw in Reader mode on Firefox for Android. Reader mode reformats web content for easy readability and operates as unprivileged content that is the equivalent of the formatted content. When Reader mode is unable to process content, it displays the original web pages. Since it is unprivileged, there are no restrictions on pages linking to or framing Reader mode content. The reported flaw is that privileged URLs can be passed to Reader mode and bypass the normal restrictions that prevent web pages from obtaining references to privileged contexts. If this issue was combined with another flaw that allowed for a violation of the same-origin policy, then the resulting combination could lead to arbitrary code execution. This flaw only affects Firefox for Android and pre-release versions of Desktop Firefox. The released version of desktop Firefox does not have reader mode and is not affected."

This was derived from an old version of the Bionic libc library and suffered from insufficient randomness in the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) as described by Roee Hay and Roi Saltzman. This leaves Firefox on Android potentially vulnerable to DNS poisoning attacks because an attacker may be able to predict the identifier used, allowing for the spoofing of web sites and cookie theft.

The issues occurred in MP4 format video file while parsing cover metadata, leading to a buffer overflow. This results in a potentially exploitable crash and can be triggered by a malformed MP4 file served by web content. In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts."

        "title": "Privilege escalation vulnerabilities in WebExtension APIs",
        "description": "Mozilla developer Kris Maglione reported a mechanism where WebExtension APIs could be used to escalate privilege. This could allow arbitrary web content to execute code with the privileges of a particular WebExtension when using these API calls. Depending on the privileges of the extension used, this could result in personal information theft and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, including theft of browser cookies. This is mitigated by the requirement to have a WebExtension installed that is vulnerable to this issue."

        "title": "Information disclosure via the High Resolution Time API",
        "description": "Security researchers Yossef Oren, Vasileios P. Kemerlis, Simha Sethumadhavan, Angelos D. Keromytis of Columbia University's Network Security Lab reported a method of using the High Resolution Time API for side channel attacks. This attack uses JavaScript loaded through a hostile web page to track access to the last-level cache over a period of time as a user engages in other browser activity. This attack takes advantage of the performance.now() API's use of single nanosecond resolution for timing. Security researcher Amit Klein independently reported use of the performance.now() API on Windows systems to extract the Windows counter frequency as an avenue for side channel attacks. Both of these flaws allow for the disclosure of private information, user fingerprinting, and data leakage. They have been addressed by reducing the resolution of the performance.now() API to 5 microseconds to remove the precision in resolution available to attackers. The Windows counter frequency issue does not affect Linux or OS X systems."

        "description": "Mozilla fixed a bug in the l10n localization of the default homescreen app of Firefox OS reported by security researcher Muneaki Nishimura. Exploiting this issue requires tricking the user into bookmarking a specially crafted web page via the 'Add to home screen' functionality. As a result, an iframe controlled by the attacker would be executed with homescreen privileges, potentially leading to further system compromise."
