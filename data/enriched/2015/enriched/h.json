In some implementations of mDNS, the mDNS server replies to unicast queries from outside the link local network (e.g., the WAN). This mDNS response may result in information disclosure of devices on the network. Furthermore, the information returned in the response is greater in size than the query and may be used for denial-of-service (DoS) amplification.RFC 6762 Section 5.5 states the following:\"In specialized applications there may be rare situations where it makes sense for a Multicast DNS querier to send its query via unicast to a specific machine. When a Multicast DNS responder receives a query via direct unicast, it SHOULD respond as it would for \"QU\" questions, as described above in Section 5.4. Since it is possible for a unicast query to be received from a machine outside the local link, responders SHOULD check that the source address in the query packet matches the local subnet for that link (or, in the case of IPv6, the source address has an on-link prefix) and silently ignore the packet if not. There may be specialized situations, outside the scope of this document, where it is intended and desirable to create a responder that does answer queries originating outside the local link.\"While unicast queries originating from outside the local link are not specifically disallowed, RFC 6762 recommends to ignore any such packets. Some implementations of mDNS do however respond to unicast queries originating outside the local link, possibly for specialized use cases beyond the scope of RFC 6762. In these circumstances, the mDNS response to a query from outside the local link allows for information disclosure about devices on the network, such as model number and operating system.Additionally, the mDNS response to a query from outside the local link may be used for denial of service amplification attacks, due to the larger response size compared to the query size.More information can be found in security researcher's blog.",

An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability may cause the Total Commander application to unexpectedly terminate.This attack has been noted in at least two different file types due to the software's improper use of the strncmp function.COFF Archive Library (.lib) files may be used by specifying overly large values for the 'Size' field of the Archive Member Header or the \"Number Of Symbols\" field in the 1st Linker Member.Linear Executable files may be used by specifying overly large values for the \"Resource Table Count\" field of the LE Header or the \"Object\" field at offset 0x8 from a \"Resource Table Entry\".Out-of-bounds reads may allow remote code execution in some circumstances; the CERT/CC is currently unaware of such an attack on the Total Commander File Info plugin, however.",

This vulnerability affects version 2.22.20142.166 and previous versions.The API functions GetProperty's info_getproperty and UdfCodeList are vulnerable, and are identified by CVE-2015-2901. These functions do not properly check input sizes, allowing buffer overflows. This vulnerability only affects version 2.22.20142.166.CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow - CVE-2015-2899An unauthenticated remote attacker may send a specially crafted packet over port 8190 and cause a heap buffer overflow. The QualifierList API function retrieve_qualifier_list may be overflowed if a list name is too long. This vulnerability affects version 2.22.20142.166 and previous versions.CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write - CVE-2015-2900An unauthenticated remote attacker may send a specially crafted packet over port 8190 and may overwrite data in memory. The AddUserFinding API function add_userfinding2 may be used to overwrite memory. This vulnerability affects version 2.22.20142.166 and previous versions.CWE-197: Numeric Truncation ErrorCWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow - CVE-2015-6006An unauthenticated remote attacker may send a specially crafted packet over port 8190 that may allow writing to out of bounds memory due to improper integer truncation. AddUserFinding accepts a user-controlled string and uses the length of the string to calculate where in the buffer to place data. If this string is above a length of 0x7fff, it will be truncated to a negative value and allow an attacker to write to memory outside of the bounds of the buffer. An attacker may be able to gain control of the flow of the program. This vulnerability was introduced in version 2.22.20153.223.",
