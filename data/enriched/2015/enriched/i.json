This inparticular allows them to disable memory and I/O decoding on thedevice unless the device is an SR-IOV virtual function, in which casesubsequent accesses to the respective MMIO or I/O port ranges would- - on PCI Express devices - lead to Unsupported Request responses. Thetreatmeant of such errors is platform specific.IMPACT======In the event that the platform surfaces aforementioned UR responses asNon-Maskable Interrupts, and either the OS is configured to treat NMIsas fatal or (e.g. via ACPI's APEI) the platform tells the OS to treatthese errors as fatal, the host would crash, leading to a Denial ofService.VULNERABLE SYSTEMS==================Xen versions 3.3 and onwards are vulnerable due to supporting PCIpass-through. Upstream Linux versions 3.1 and onwards are vulnerabledue to supporting PCI backend functionality. Other Linux versions aswell as other OS versions may be vulnerable too.Any domain which is given access to a non-SR-IOV virtual function PCIExpress device can take advantage of this vulnerability.MITIGATION==========This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI Express devices otherthan SR-IOV virtual functions to untrusted guests.RESOLUTION==========Applying the attached patch resolves this issue for upstream Linux.xsa120.patch Linux 3.19$ sha256sum xsa120*.patch5167215293d4a8a05f090fca5b20eb5878213a0158a0e7a12c245553db81a855 xsa120.patch"

        "description": "Description Vasyl Kaigorodov 2015-03-23 12:26:23 UTC Quentin Casasnovas reported on http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/877:\"\"\"Jamie and I discovered there was a flaw in the way the xsave/xrstor (andtheir alternative instructions) were being protected against a fault inkernel space from linux 3.15. The problem was introduced in commit f31a9f7(\"x86/xsaves: Use xsaves/xrstors to save and restore xsave area\") whichends up protecting the .altinstr_replacement from faulting instead of thetarget of the alternative in .text, leaving the instruction un-protected.You can find a reproducer (thanks to Allan for his help with/comments onit!) triggering the fault in kernel space attached to this e-mail but itshould be noted there are a few different places where these instructionsare used un-protected and the reproducer only uses one of them present inthe kvm code. You can find a list of all such places in the attachedunprotected_xsave_faults attachment which was generated against a v4.0-rc1defconfig + CONFIG_KVM vmlinux.o (the most concerning one probably being in__switch_to()). The reproducer is a patch to apply on top of lkvm(https://github.com/penberg/linux-kvm) but it should be trivial to write asa standalone C application.It should be noted that this vulnerability is present even if the hardwaredoes not support xsaveS.This is fixed by upstream commit 06c8173eb: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=06c8173eb92bbfc03a0fe8bb64315857d0badd06\"\"\"Also, more detailed problem description:\"\"\"We have two different mecanisms in the kernel that are involved here: - the alternative instructions: it allows the Linux kernel to self-modify its running code to use optimized instructions when they are available on the host CPU. The way it works is that the initial instruction in .text is supported by all CPU variants and we add optimized version of the instruction in the .altinstr_replacement section. At boot, or when loading a kernel module, the kernel will replace the instruction in .text by its optimized version from .altinstr_replacement if the CPU supports it, we can see it as something like this: if (cpu_has_fexture_X()) memcpy(.text, .altinstr_replacement, sizeof(instruction)); The CPU will never have its instruction pointer pointing in .altinstr_replacement, this is just used as a memory source when applying the alternative instructions. - the ex_table entries: it allows the kernel to mark addresses where a fault might occur but should not cause a panic. It works by storing in the __ex_table section a pair of addresses, the first one being the address of the instruction which could fault, and the second is where the execution should continue when that fault happens. On page fault in kernel space, the page fault handler will check if there is an ex_table entry corresponding to where the fault happened, and if that's the case, will restore the CPU context with RIP pointing to that second address. This is how copy_from_user() does not panic the kernel when the userland pointer given as argument is borked for example.Now, the xsave instruction (or its alternatives xsaveopt and xsaves) couldfault for different reasons (unaligned memory operands, non-cannonicaladdress memory operand, ...), so we want to have an ex_table entry pointingto the xsave instruction in .text so that if it faults, the kernel does notdie but simply continue its normal flaw and return an error to the caller.> https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=f31a9f7c71691569359fa7fb8b0acaa44bce0324The problem with the above commit is that it correctly added an ex_tableentry to prevent this, but the pointer to the instruction which might faultwas not pointing to .text but to .altinstr_replacement. The effect is thatif userspace manages to trigger the fault on xsave (which is in .text), thepage fault handler will never find a corresponding ex_table entry and willconsider this as an unhandled fault. The fix is to make the ex_table entryproperly point to .text and not to .altinstr_replacement so the kernelproperly handles the fault and does not die.\"\"\""

Sidhpurwala 2015-12-04 03:45:34 UTC The following was reported by OpenSSL upstream:There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.This issue affects OpenSSL version 1.0.2.OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2eThis issue was reported to OpenSSL on August 13 2015 by Hanno Böck.

        "description": "Description John Sullivan 2015-05-28 16:58:30 UTC Originally found in:openssl-1.0.1e-30.el6_6.4.src.rpmApparently introduced in:openssl-1.0.1e-25.el7.src.rpmopenssl-1.0.1e-34.fc20.src.rpmAccidentally(?) fixed in:openssl-1.0.1i-1.fc21.src.rpmStill present (I believe) in RH6/RH7/FC20. (Raising against Fedora because I currently use FC20 as my main desktop OS, though others will consider RH the more important packages.)This patch from Tomáš Mráz in November 2013, amongst other things, refactored the PRNG locking into a single function, private_RAND_lock():https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/scm-commits/Week-of-Mon-20131118/1146865.htmlNeither the provenance, nor need, for this particular part of the patch is entirely clear. It doesn't appear to have ever been part of upstream openssl. AFAICT it originated either in RH or Fedora about then, was duplicated into both distros (and therefore picked up automatically by downstream distros such as CentOS as well). The particular problem is the change from ssleay_rand_bytes(): if (!do_not_lock) { CRYPTO_w_lock(CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND); /* prevent ssleay_rand_bytes() from trying to obtain the lock again */ CRYPTO_w_lock(CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND2); CRYPTO_THREADID_cpy(&locking_threadid, &cur); CRYPTO_w_unlock(CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND2); crypto_lock_rand = 1; }To private_LOCK_rand(): if (do_lock) { CRYPTO_w_lock(CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND); crypto_lock_rand = 1; CRYPTO_w_lock(CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND2); CRYPTO_THREADID_current(&locking_threadid); CRYPTO_w_unlock(CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND2); }(RAND is the main lock that protects the real critical section. RAND2 isn't a real critical section as such, but forces readers/writers of locking_threadid to do so atomically since thread ids are now a multi-word struct. crypto_lock_rand/locking_threadid are used to allow a recursive mutex to be built on top of the external lock API which provides only non-recursive rwlocks.)Excitingly, this reintroduces a really old upstream bug from 2001:https://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-dev@openssl.org/msg09018.htmlIn a multi-threaded program with multiple threads calling RAND_bytes(), the following can happen:1) thread-A calls RAND_bytes() and completes normally. LOCK_RAND is left unlocked, crypto_lock_rand is 0, and locking_threadid remains set to thread-A's id.2) thread-B calls RAND_bytes(), and gets as far as setting crypto_lock_rand=1 before being pre-empted just before it takes the RAND2 lock.3) thread-A calls into RAND_bytes() again, sees that crypto_lock_rand==1, takes RAND2 before thread-B can, sees its own thread id in locking_threadid, and enters the main critical section without bothering to take the RAND lock4) thread-B takes RAND2, sets its own thread id, and also enters the main critical section5) Within the critical section in ssleay_rand_bytes() both threads execute: st_idx=state_index; st_num=state_num;[...] state_index+=num_ceil; if (state_index > state_num) state_index %= state_num;The += and %= are done as two separate memory writes, so one thread can read st_idx in between the other thread executing the writes. It can therefore see st_idx>st_num.6) If st_idx+(MD_DIGEST_LENGTH/2)<=st_num, we feed that part of state[] into the hash function as a single block. If however it is > st_num, we feed it in as two separate blocks, the part from st_idx to the end of state[], then the part from state[0] up to the remaining number of bytes. If st_idx itself is > st_num, the former calculation results in a \"negative\" length passed to the hash, which causes it to start reading memory from past the end of state[] and continue around the entire address space until it wraps round to the actual end of state[]. During this loop it eventually hits an unmapped page and segfaults. (The actual final effects may depend on which optimised version of the hash function openssl chooses, in our case with the default SHA1 we were running on SSSE3 capable x86_64 hardware.)In a multi-threaded server handling TLS connections, for appropriate ciphersuites, we read one block's worth of random for each TLS record transmitted to form the IV for the block cipher. With multiple threads fielding TLS connections, under moderate load, this causes repeated crashes anywhere from minutes to hours apart. (This isn't specifically a security bug: completely non-malicious traffic at entirely reasonable load levels triggers it.)This part of the patch was actually removed during FC21, as part of the upgrade from 1.0.1h to 1.0.1i. There appears to be no reason given why they were deemed no longer necessary (other parts of the patch remain), which makes me think fixing this bug was not the motivation. Distros that are still on 1.0.1e (FC20/RH* and others) remain affected. If the refactor is still required (and apart from this issue I think it's actually better code) for those versions, the fix is simple enough:--- openssl-1.0.1e/crypto/rand/rand_lib.c.randlock2015-05-14 14:48:26.073062716 +0100+++ openssl-1.0.1e/crypto/rand/rand_lib.c2015-05-14 14:50:02.907762929 +0100@@ -208,10 +208,10 @@ if (do_lock) { CRYPTO_w_lock(CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND);-crypto_lock_rand = 1; CRYPTO_w_lock(CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND2); CRYPTO_THREADID_current(&locking_threadid); CRYPTO_w_unlock(CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND2);+crypto_lock_rand = 1; } return do_lock; }"

        "description": "Description Vasyl Kaigorodov 2015-07-22 14:16:24 UTC It was reported that polkit has a bug, that leads to a minor denial of service, or code execution/privilege escalation.The only privilege necessary is ability to send D-Bus messages, not even necessarily directly to polkitd (usually privileged services ask polkitd for authorization based of a client request: client<->D-Bus<->service<->D-Bus<->polkitd); the attacker does not need special polkit status.This bug allows a local user (a person on a multi-user system, or a daemon account after successfully attacking a daemon over the network) to corrupt memory of polkitd.Corrupting polkitd memory can lead to a crash (known to happen), which is a minor DoS: a specific request being handled during the crash will not get a reply, but polkitd will then be automatically started when next polkit request arrives.In general corrupting memory can lead to arbitrary code execution as polkitd (no proof of concept exists but I can see no reason for this to be impossible), controlling polkitd allows the attacker to grant to anyone access to any polkit-controlled service, including the ability to run any command as root via pkexec.Initially reported in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=910262The patches are attached."

The GRO functionality can create a situation in which multiple SKB's are chained togetherin a single packets fraglist (by design). The virtio module declares support for NETIF_F_FRAGLIST and assumes that there are at most MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 2 fragments which isn't always true with a fraglist, when GRO is enabled on the incoming driver it can create more fragments than expected.A longer than expected fragment list in the socket buffer will make the call to skb_to_sgvec overflow the sg array, leading to memory corruption.

Sidhpurwala 2015-12-10 05:01:50 UTC As per samba upstream advisory:All versions of Samba from 3.0.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive are vulnerable to a bug in symlink verification, which under certain circumstances could allow client access to files outside the exported share path.If a Samba share is configured with a path that shares a common path prefix with another directory on the file system, the smbd daemon may allow the client to follow a symlink pointing to a file or directory in that other directory, even if the share parameter \"wide links\" isset to \"no\" (the default).For example. Given two directories on the file system:/share//share1/If a Samba share is created as follows:[sharename] path = /share wide links = noThen a symlink with the path/share/symlink -> /share1/filewould be followed by smbd, due to the fact that only the string \"/share\" is checked to see if it matches the target path. This means a path that starts with \"/share\", such as \"/share1\" will also match.The following mitigation was suggested by upstream:Ensure all exported share paths do not share base path names with other directories on the file system.Please note, setting the smb.conf variable \"follow symlinks = no\" is *NOT* a workaround for this problem, as this only prohibits smbd from following a symlink at the end of a path.A symlink could be created that points to the directory which shares a base path name instead, and smbd would still follow that link. For example, with the above share definition, given a symlink of:/share/symlink -> /share1a client could send a relative path such as \"symlink/file\", which would still be followed by smbd as the end component \"file\" of \"symlink/file\" is *NOT* a symlink, and so is not affected by \"follow symlinks = no\"."

The last two changes got reverted immediately, but the multiboot and multiboot2 modules remained built in.Those modules /should not/ function on UEFI systems, but there's no code in them that actually stops them from doing so, and therefore they allow a user to load non-verified code, such as tools to circumvent Secure Boot.Since Secure Boot is a security feature of RHEL 7, that means this is a security problem in RHEL 7.Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):It's everything in RHEL 7.How reproducible:100% of the time; there's no conditional behavior here. The user can do it from the boot menu of there's no password set, or if they've already rooted the machine they can do it from the config file.Steps to Reproduce:1. write a multiboot module that replaces some EFI runtime call pointers or whatever other attack you might like2. add it to the configfile to load before the linux kernel, loading the kernel as a mutliboot module.3. reboot.Actual results:linux thinks secure boot is intact when in fact it has been circumvented and boot time rootkits are present.Expected results:the module is rejected.\"\"\""

This check triggering would leak information about the value of the padding bytes and could be used to perform iterative decryption.As with most such oracle attacks, the danger depends on the underlying protocol - HTTP servers are particularly vulnerable.

        "description": "Description Adam Mariš 2015-11-05 15:49:08 UTC It was found that a malicious HVM guest administrator can cause DoS, specifically prevent use of physical CPU for significant, perhaps indefinite period. When a benign exception occurs while delivering another benign exception, it is architecturally specified that these would be delivered sequentially. There are, however, cases where this results in an infinite loop inside the CPU, which (in the virtualized case) can be broken only by intercepting delivery of the respective exception.When a guest sets up a hardware breakpoint covering a data structure involved in delivering #DB (Debug Exception), upon completion of the delivery of the first exception another #DB will need to be delivered. The effects slightly differ depending on further guest characteristics:* Guests running in 32-bit mode would be expected to sooner or later encounter another fault due to the stack pointer decreasing during each iteration of the loop. The most likely case would be #PF (Page Fault) due to running into unmapped virtual space. However, an infinite loop cannot be excluded (e.g. when the guest is running with paging disabled).* Guests running in long mode, but not using the IST (Interrupt Stack Table) feature for the IDT entry corresponding to #DB would behave similarly to guests running in 32-bit mode, just that the larger virtual address space allows for a much longer loop. The loop can't, however, be infinite, as eventually the stack pointer would move into non-canonical address space, causing #SS (Stack Fault) instead.* Guests running in long mode and using the IST for the IDT entry corresponding to #DB would enter an infinite loop, as the stack pointer wouldn't change between #DB instances.If a host watchdog (Xen or dom0) is in use, this can lead to a watchdog timeout and consequently a reboot of the host. If another, innocent, guest, is configured with a watchdog, this issue can lead to a reboot of such a guest.A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS.For KVM virtualisation, it only affects the AMD processor support, as for Intel it already intercepts the #DB exception.Upstream KVM patch:------------------- -> http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2082332References:----------- -> http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/11/10/1"
