This is CVE-2014-0069cifs_iovec_write isn't set up to handle that situation however. It'llblindly keep chugging through the page array and not filling those pageswith anything useful. Worse yet, we'll later end up with a negativenumber in wdata->tailsz, which will confuse the sending routines andcause an oops at the very least.Fix this by having the copy phase of cifs_iovec_write stop copying datain this situation and send the last write as a short one. At the sametime, we want to avoid sending a zero-length write to the server, sobreak out of the loop and set rc to -EFAULT if that happens. This alsoallows us to handle the case where no address in the iovec is valid.[Note: Marking this for stable on v3.4+ kernels, but kernels as old as v2.6.38 may have a similar problem and may need similar fix]Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org> # v3.4+Reviewed-by: Pavel Shilovsky <piastry@etersoft.ru>Reported-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>Signed-off-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com>Signed-off-by: Steve French <smfrench@gmail.com>"

Receiving Authenticated Chunks says: The receiver MUST use the HMAC algorithm indicated in the HMAC Identifier field. If this algorithm was not specified by the receiver in the HMAC-ALGO parameter in the INIT or INIT-ACK chunk during association setup, the AUTH chunk and all the chunks after it MUST be discarded and an ERROR chunk SHOULD be sent with the error cause defined in Section 4.1. [...] If no endpoint pair shared key has been configured for that Shared Key Identifier, all authenticated chunks MUST be silently discarded. [...] When an endpoint requires COOKIE-ECHO chunks to be authenticated, some special procedures have to be followed because the reception of a COOKIE-ECHO chunk might result in the creation of an SCTP association. If a packet arrives containing an AUTH chunk as a first chunk, a COOKIE-ECHO chunk as the second chunk, and possibly more chunks after them, and the receiver does not have an STCB for that packet, then authentication is based on the contents of the COOKIE-ECHO chunk. In this situation, the receiver MUST authenticate the chunks in the packet by using the RANDOM parameters, CHUNKS parameters and HMAC_ALGO parameters obtained from the COOKIE-ECHO chunk, and possibly a local shared secret as inputs to the authentication procedure specified in Section 6.3. If authentication fails, then the packet is discarded. If the authentication is successful, the COOKIE-ECHO and all the chunks after the COOKIE-ECHO MUST be processed. If the receiver has an STCB, it MUST process the AUTH chunk as described above using the STCB from the existing association to authenticate the COOKIE-ECHO chunk and all the chunks after it. [...]Commit bbd0d59 introduced the possibility to receiveand verification of AUTH chunk, including the edge case forauthenticated COOKIE-ECHO. On reception of COOKIE-ECHO,the function sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce() handles processing,unpacks and creates a new association if it passed sanitychecks and also tests for authentication chunks beingpresent. After a new association has been processed, itinvokes sctp_process_init() on the new association andwalks through the parameter list it received from the INITchunk. It checks SCTP_PARAM_RANDOM, SCTP_PARAM_HMAC_ALGOand SCTP_PARAM_CHUNKS, and copies them into asoc->peermeta data (peer_random, peer_hmacs, peer_chunks) in casesysctl -w net.sctp.auth_enable=1 is set. If in INIT'sSCTP_PARAM_SUPPORTED_EXT parameter SCTP_CID_AUTH is set,peer_random != NULL and peer_hmacs != NULL the peer is to beassumed asoc->peer.auth_capable=1, in any other caseasoc->peer.auth_capable=0.Now, if in sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce() chunk->auth_chunk isavailable, we set up a fake auth chunk and pass that on tosctp_sf_authenticate(), which at latest insctp_auth_calculate_hmac() reliably dereferences a NULL pointerat position 0..0008 when setting up the crypto key incrypto_hash_setkey() by using asoc->asoc_shared_key that isNULL as condition key_id == asoc->active_key_id is true ifthe AUTH chunk was injected correctly from remote. Thishappens no matter what net.sctp.auth_enable sysctl says.The fix is to check for net->sctp.auth_enable and forasoc->peer.auth_capable before doing any operations likesctp_sf_authenticate() as no key is activated insctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() for each case.Now as RFC4895 section 6.3 states that if the used HMAC-ALGOpassed from the INIT chunk was not used in the AUTH chunk, weSHOULD send an error; however in this case it would be betterto just silently discard such a maliciously prepared handshakeas we didn't even receive a parameter at all. Also, as ourendpoint has no shared key configured, section 6.3 says thatMUST silently discard, which we are doing from now onwards.Before calling sctp_sf_pdiscard(), we need not only to freethe association, but also the chunk->auth_chunk skb, ascommit bbd0d59 created a skb clone in that case.I have tested this locally by using netfilter's nfqueue andre-injecting packets into the local stack after maliciouslymodifying the INIT chunk (removing RANDOM; HMAC-ALGO param)and the SCTP packet containing the COOKIE_ECHO (injectingAUTH chunk before COOKIE_ECHO).

However, this cannothappen because of the condition that can trigger the error:- out of memory (where you can't allocate even a single page) should not be possible for the attacker to trigger- when exceeding the iommu's address space, guest pages after gfn will also exceed the iommu's address space, and inside kvm_iommu_put_pages() the iommu_iova_to_phys() will fail. The page thus would not be unpinned at all.Reported-by: Jack Morgenstein <jackm@mellanox.com>Cc: stable@vger.kernel.orgSigned-off-by: Michael S.

Here, theAddress Parameter in the ASCONF chunk is even missing, too.This is just an example and similarly-crafted ASCONF chunkscould be used just as well.The ASCONF chunk passes through sctp_verify_asconf() as allparameters passed sanity checks, and after walking, we endedup successfully at the chunk end boundary, and thus may invokesctp_process_asconf(). Parameter walking is done withWORD_ROUND() to take padding into account.In sctp_process_asconf()'s TLV processing, we may fail insctp_process_asconf_param() e.g., due to removal of the IPaddress that is also the source address of the packet containingthe ASCONF chunk, and thus we need to add all TLVs after thefailure to our ASCONF response to remote via helper functionsctp_add_asconf_response(), which basically invokes asctp_addto_chunk() adding the error parameters to the givenskb.When walking to the next parameter this time, we proceedwith ... length = ntohs(asconf_param->param_hdr.length); asconf_param = (void *)asconf_param + length;... instead of the WORD_ROUND()'ed length, thus resulting herein an off-by-one that leads to reading the follow-up garbageparameter length of 12336, and thus throwing an skb_over_panicfor the reply when trying to sctp_addto_chunk() next time,which implicitly calls the skb_put() with that length.Fix it by using sctp_walk_params() [ which is also used inINIT parameter processing ] macro in the verification *and*in ASCONF processing: it will make sure we don't spill over,that we walk parameters WORD_ROUND()'ed. Moreover, we're beingmore defensive and guard against unknown parameter types andmissized addresses.Joint work with Vlad Yasevich.Fixes: b896b82 (\"[SCTP] ADDIP: Support for processing incoming ASCONF_ACK chunks.\")Signed-off-by: Daniel Borkmann <dborkman@redhat.com>Signed-off-by: Vlad Yasevich <vyasevich@gmail.com>Acked-by: Neil Horman <nhorman@tuxdriver.com>Signed-off-by: David S.

SCTP doesonly do verification on a chunk by chunk basis, as an SCTPpacket is nothing more than just a container of a stream ofchunks which it eats up one by one.We could run into the case that we receive a packet with amalformed tail, above marked as trailing JUNK. All previouschunks are here goodformed, so the stack will eat up allprevious chunks up to this point. In case JUNK does not fitinto a chunk header and there are no more other chunks inthe input queue, or in case JUNK contains a garbage chunkheader, but the encoded chunk length would exceed the skbtail, or we came here from an entirely different scenarioand the chunk has pdiscard=1 mark (without having had a flushpoint), it will happen, that we will excessively queue upthe association's output queue (a correct final chunk maythen turn it into a response flood when flushing thequeue ;)): I ran a simple script with incremental ASCONFserial numbers and could see the server side consumingexcessive amount of RAM [before/after: up to 2GB and more].The issue at heart is that the chunk train basically endswith !end_of_packet and !singleton markers and since commit2e3216c (\"sctp: Follow security requirement of respondingwith 1 packet\") therefore preventing an output queue flushpoint in sctp_do_sm() -> sctp_cmd_interpreter() on the inputchunk (chunk = event_arg) even though local_cork is set,but its precedence has changed since then. In the normalcase, the last chunk with end_of_packet=1 would trigger thequeue flush to accommodate possible outgoing bundling.In the input queue, sctp_inq_pop() seems to do the right thingin terms of discarding invalid chunks. So, above JUNK willnot enter the state machine and instead be released and exitthe sctp_assoc_bh_rcv() chunk processing loop. It's simplythe flush point being missing at loop exit. Adding a try-flushapproach on the output queue might not work as the underlyinginfrastructure might be long gone at this point due to theside-effect interpreter run.One possibility, albeit a bit of a kludge, would be to deferinvalid chunk freeing into the state machine in order topossibly trigger packet discards and thus indirectly a queueflush on error. It would surely be better to discard chunksas in the current, perhaps better controlled environment, butgoing back and forth, it's simply architecturally not possible.I tried various trailing JUNK attack cases and it seems tolook good now.Joint work with Vlad Yasevich.Fixes: 2e3216c (\"sctp: Follow security requirement of responding with 1 packet\")Signed-off-by: Daniel Borkmann <dborkman@redhat.com>Signed-off-by: Vlad Yasevich <vyasevich@gmail.com>Signed-off-by: David S.

As a result, thesecond and all following groups of multiple keys by kvno are eachstored in two krbPrincipalKey attribute values. Fix the loop to usethe correct kvno value.CVE-2014-4345:In MIT krb5, when kadmind is configured to use LDAP for the KDCdatabase, an authenticated remote attacker can cause it to perform anout-of-bounds write (buffer overrun) by performing multiple cpw-keepold operations. An off-by-one error while copying keyinformation to the new database entry results in keys sharing a commonkvno being written to different array buckets, in an array whose sizeis determined by the number of kvnos present. After sufficientiterations, the extra writes extend past the end of the(NULL-terminated) array. The NULL terminator is always written afterthe end of the loop, so no out-of-bounds data is read, it is onlywritten.Historically, it has been possible to convert an out-of-bounds writeinto remote code execution in some cases, though the necessaryexploits must be tailored to the individual application and areusually quite complicated. Depending on the allocated length of thearray, an out-of-bounds write may also cause a segmentation faultand/or application crash.

These values are not changed during the lifetime of an SCTP association. Looking at new SCTP extensions, there is the need to have a method of proving that an SCTP chunk(s) was really sent by the original peer that started the association and not by a malicious attacker.To cause this bug, we're triggering an INIT collision betweenpeers; normal SCTP handshake where both sides intent toauthenticate packets contains RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGOparameters that are being negotiated among peers: ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ----------> <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] --------- -------------------- COOKIE-ECHO --------------------> <-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------RFC4895 says that each endpoint therefore knows its own randomnumber and the peer's random number *after* the associationhas been established. The local and peer's random number alongwith the shared key are then part of the secret used forcalculating the HMAC in the AUTH chunk.Now, in our scenario, we have 2 threads with 1 non-blockingSEQ_PACKET socket each, setting up common shared SCTP_AUTH_KEYand SCTP_AUTH_ACTIVE_KEY properly, and each of them callingsctp_bindx(3), listen(2) and connect(2) against each other,thus the handshake looks similar to this, e.g.: ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ----------> <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] --------- <--------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ----------- -------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] --------> ...Since such collisions can also happen with verification tags,the RFC4895 for AUTH rather vaguely says under section 6.1: In case of INIT collision, the rules governing the handling of this Random Number follow the same pattern as those for the Verification Tag, as explained in Section 5.2.4 of RFC 2960 [5]. Therefore, each endpoint knows its own Random Number and the peer's Random Number after the association has been established.In RFC2960, section 5.2.4, we're eventually hitting Action B: B) In this case, both sides may be attempting to start an association at about the same time but the peer endpoint started its INIT after responding to the local endpoint's INIT. Thus it may have picked a new Verification Tag not being aware of the previous Tag it had sent this endpoint. The endpoint should stay in or enter the ESTABLISHED state but it MUST update its peer's Verification Tag from the State Cookie, stop any init or cookie timers that may running and send a COOKIE ACK.In other words, the handling of the Random parameter is thesame as behavior for the Verification Tag as described inAction B of section 5.2.4.Looking at the code, we exactly hit the sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b()case which triggers an SCTP_CMD_UPDATE_ASSOC command to theside effect interpreter, and in fact it properly copies overpeer_{random, hmacs, chunks} parameters from the newly createdassociation to update the existing one.Also, the old asoc_shared_key is being released and based onthe new params, sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() updated.However, the issue observed in this case is that the previousasoc->peer.auth_capable was 0, and has *not* been updated, sothat instead of creating a new secret, we're doing an earlyreturn from the function sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key()leaving asoc->asoc_shared_key as NULL. However, we now have toauthenticate chunks from the updated chunk list (e.g. COOKIE-ACK).That in fact causes the server side when responding with ... <------------------ AUTH; COOKIE-ACK -----------------... to trigger a NULL pointer dereference, since insctp_packet_transmit(), it discovers that an AUTH chunk isbeing queued for xmit, and thus it calls sctp_auth_calculate_hmac().Since the asoc->active_key_id is still inherited from theendpoint, and the same as encoded into the chunk, it usesasoc->asoc_shared_key, which is still NULL, as an asoc_keyand dereferences it in ... crypto_hash_setkey(desc.tfm, &asoc_key->data[0], asoc_key->len)... causing an oops. All this happens because sctp_make_cookie_ack()called with the *new* association has the peer.auth_capable=1and therefore marks the chunk with auth=1 after checkingsctp_auth_send_cid(), but it is *actually* sent later on overthe then *updated* association's transport that didn't initializeits shared key due to peer.auth_capable=0. Since control chunksin that case are not sent by the temporary association whichare scheduled for deletion, they are issued for xmit viaSCTP_CMD_REPLY in the interpreter with the context of the*updated* association. peer.auth_capable was 0 in the updatedassociation (which went from COOKIE_WAIT into ESTABLISHED state),since all previous processing that performed sctp_process_init()was being done on temporary associations, that we eventuallythrow away each time.The correct fix is to update to the new peer.auth_capablevalue as well in the collision case via sctp_assoc_update(),so that in case the collision migrated from 0 -> 1,sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() can properly recalculatethe secret. This therefore fixes the observed server panic.Fixes: 730fc3d (\"[SCTP]: Implete SCTP-AUTH parameter processing\")Reported-by: Jason Gunthorpe <jgunthorpe@obsidianresearch.com>Signed-off-by: Daniel Borkmann <dborkman@redhat.com>Tested-by: Jason Gunthorpe <jgunthorpe@obsidianresearch.com>Cc: Vlad Yasevich <vyasevich@gmail.com>Acked-by: Vlad Yasevich <vyasevich@gmail.com>Signed-off-by: David S.

Theseflags are all per superblock, can all be changed with MS_BIND,and should not be changable if set by a more privileged user.The following additions to the current logic are added in this patch.- nosuid may not be clearable by a less privileged user.- nodev may not be clearable by a less privielged user.- noexec may not be clearable by a less privileged user.- atime flags may not be changeable by a less privileged user.The logic with atime is that always setting atime on access is aglobal policy and backup software and auditing software could break ifatime bits are not updated (when they are configured to be updated),and serious performance degradation could result (DOS attack) if atimeupdates happen when they have been explicitly disabled. Therefore anunprivileged user should not be able to mess with the atime bits setby a more privileged user.The additional restrictions are implemented with the addition ofMNT_LOCK_NOSUID, MNT_LOCK_NODEV, MNT_LOCK_NOEXEC, and MNT_LOCK_ATIMEmnt flags.Taken together these changes and the fixes for MNT_LOCK_READONLYshould make it safe for an unprivileged user to create a usernamespace and to call \"mount --bind -o remount,... ...\" withoutthe danger of mount flags being changed maliciously.Cc: stable@vger.kernel.orgAcked-by: Serge E.

This fixes a nulldereference when an admin attempts to use an LDAP ticket policy nameas a password policy name.CVE-2014-5353:In MIT krb5, when kadmind is configured to use LDAP for the KDCdatabase, an authenticated remote attacker can cause a NULL dereferenceby attempting to use a named ticket policy object as a password policyfor a principal. The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user whohas the elevated privilege for setting password policy by adding ormodifying principals.Queries to LDAP scoped to the krbPwdPolicy object class will correctlynot return entries of other classes, such as ticket policy objects, butmay return success with no returned elements if an object with therequested DN exists in a different object class. In this case, theroutine to retrieve a password policy returned success with a passwordpolicy object that consisted entirely of zeroed memory. In particular,accesses to the policy name will dereference a NULL pointer. KDCoperation does not access the policy name field, but most kadminoperations involving the principal with incorrect password policywill trigger the crash.Thanks to Patrik Kis for reporting this problem.CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C[kaduk@mit.edu: CVE description and CVSS score]ticket: 8051 (new)target_version: 1.13.1tags: pullup"

        "body": "Commit f5ea110 (\"xfs: add CRCs to dir2/da node blocks\") introducedin 3.10 incorrectly converted the btree hash index array pointer inxfs_da3_fixhashpath(). It resulted in the the current hash alwaysbeing compared against the first entry in the btree rather than thecurrent block index into the btree block's hash entry array. As aresult, it was comparing the wrong hashes, and so could misorder theentries in the btree.For most cases, this doesn't cause any problems as it requires hashcollisions to expose the ordering problem. However, when there arehash collisions within a directory there is a very good probabilitythat the entries will be ordered incorrectly and that actuallymatters when duplicate hashes are placed into or removed from thebtree block hash entry array.This bug results in an on-disk directory corruption and that resultsin directory verifier functions throwing corruption warnings intothe logs. While no data or directory entries are lost, access tothem may be compromised, and attempts to remove entries from adirectory that has suffered from this corruption may result in afilesystem shutdown. xfs_repair will fix the directory hashordering without data loss occuring.[dchinner: wrote useful a commit message]cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>Reported-by: Hannes Frederic Sowa <hannes@stressinduktion.org>Signed-off-by: Mark Tinguely <tinguely@sgi.com>Reviewed-by: Ben Myers <bpm@sgi.com>Signed-off-by: Dave Chinner <david@fromorbit.com>"

This was realized by abusing thestatic keys api and defining a new initializer to not enable the callsite while still indicating that the branch point should get patchedup. This was needed to have the fast path considered likely by gcc.The static key initialization during boot up normally walks through allthe registered keys and either patches in ideal nops or enables the jumpsite but omitted that step on x86 if ideal nops where already placed atstatic_key branch points. Thus net_get_random_once branches not alwaysbecame active.This patch switches net_get_random_once to the ordinary static_keyapi and thus places the kernel fast path in the - by gcc considered -unlikely path. Microbenchmarks on Intel and AMD x86-64 showed thatthe unlikely path actually beats the likely path in terms of cycle costand that different nop patterns did not make much difference, thus thisswitch should not be noticeable.Fixes: a48e429 (\"net: introduce new macro net_get_random_once\")Reported-by: Tuomas Räsänen <tuomasjjrasanen@tjjr.fi>Cc: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>Signed-off-by: Hannes Frederic Sowa <hannes@stressinduktion.org>Signed-off-by: David S.

It is used inside thefunction to calculate the additionally needed skb tailroom. But instead ofincreasing its own tailroom, it is only increasing the tailroom of the firstqueued skb. This is not correct in some situations because the first queuedentry can be a different one than the parameter.An observed problem was:1. packet with size 104, total_size 1464, fragno 1 was received - packet is queued2. packet with size 1400, total_size 1464, fragno 0 was received - packet is queued at the end of the list3. enough data was received and can be given to the merge function (1464 == (1400 - 20) + (104 - 20)) - merge functions gets 1400 byte large packet as skb argument4. merge function gets first entry in queue (104 byte) - stored as skb_out5. merge function calculates the required extra tail as total_size - skb->len - pskb_expand_head tail of skb_out with 64 bytes6. merge function tries to squeeze the extra 1380 bytes from the second queued skb (1400 byte aka skb parameter) in the 64 extra tail bytes of skb_outInstead calculate the extra required tail bytes for skb_out also using skb_outinstead of using the parameter skb. The skb parameter is only used to get thetotal_size from the last received packet. This is also the total_size used todecide that all fragments were received.Reported-by: Philipp Psurek <philipp.psurek@gmail.com>Signed-off-by: Sven Eckelmann <sven@narfation.org>Acked-by: Martin Hundebøll <martin@hundeboll.net>Signed-off-by: David S.
