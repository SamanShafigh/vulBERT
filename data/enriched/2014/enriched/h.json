        "description": "OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f and 1.0.2 beta through 1.0.2-beta1 contain a flaw in its implementation of the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality (RFC6520). This flaw allows an attacker to retrieve private memory of an application that uses the vulnerable OpenSSL libssl library in chunks of up to 64k at a time. Note that an attacker can repeatedly leverage the vulnerability to increase the chances that a leaked chunk contains the intended secrets. The sensitive information that may be retrieved using this vulnerability include:Primary key material (secret keys)Secondary key material (user names and passwords used by vulnerable services)Protected content (sensitive data used by vulnerable services)Collateral (memory addresses and content that can be leveraged to bypass exploit mitigations)Please see the Heartbleed website for more details. Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. Any service that supports STARTTLS (imap,smtp,http,pop) may also be affected.",

We have confirmed Internet Explorer 10 to be vulnerable. It has been reported that Internet Explorer 9 is also affected. Other versions of Internet Explorer may also be affected.Note that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild, and the exploit code is publicly available. The exploit in the wild currently only targets Internet Explorer 10 on systems that have Adobe Flash installed and do not have EMET installed. Windows 8 comes with Flash, so no additional software is required to be vulnerable to this particular exploit on that platform. Although no Flash vulnerability appears to be at play here, the Internet Explorer vulnerability is used to corrupt Flash content in a way that allows ASLR to be bypassed via a memory address leak. This is made possible with Internet Explorer because Flash runs within the same process space as the browser. The Flash content uses this ASLR bypass to disable DEP and then execute code. The Microsoft.XMLDOM ActiveX control is used to determine if EMET is installed on the target system. This is done by checking for the presence of C:\\Windows\\AppPatch\\EMET.dll. If this file is present, the exploit attempt is aborted.",

To prevent RSA signatures from being forged, messages are padded with data to ensure message hashes are adequately sized.

The Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library incorrectly parses PKCS#1 v1.5 padded signatures due to the use of a vulnerable implementation of ASN.1 encoding of DigestInfo. Vulnerable implementations parse the DigestInfo field using the BER encoding, which allows multiple ways of encoding the same ASN.1 object. The parser implementation allows for bytes to skip validation, allowing an attacker to forge a signature when a RSA key with a low public exponent (e.g., three) is used.This vulnerability is a variant of the Bleichenbacher vulnerability, where unvalidated bytes are allowed in the least significant bytes of the signature.Mozilla NSS is used by other software products including a number of Linux distributions and packages, Google Chrome, and Google Chrome OS.

        "description": "Vulnerability Lab has reported a vulnerability in the way Mozilla Thunderbird handles HTML elements in email content. Mozilla Thunderbird blocks the creation of certain HTML elements, such as script, when displaying email messages. Traditionally, a script element is created through the use of a <script> HTML tag. HTML elements, including script, can also be created through the use of an <object> tag that specifies a Data URI scheme (RFC 2397). The Data URI can specify a text/html mime type and encode the script in base64. In such cases, Thunderbird will execute the script contained in the email message when it is forwarded or replied to and the outgoing message is in HTML format. Simply displaying the email message does not appear to cause the script to execute.See Mozilla Bug Bounty #5 - WireTap Remote Web Vulnerability for more details.Testing indicates that Thunderbird 17.0.{6,7,8} are vulnerable. Earlier versions may also be vulnerable.",

Most authentication realms use remote authentication databases. Locally defined users and user lists are in the local authentication realm. The local authentication realm is typically used for administrative and console access, but can be used for proxy users as well.When local users change their password, are deleted, or are removed from or added to a user list, changes may take up to 15 minutes to take effect due to caching. If another password-related event (such as a correct login with the new password or a rejected login due to incorrect password) occurs, the time for changes to take effect may be shorter.An attacker who knows the account password can exploit this gap to gain unauthorized administrative access through the Management Console, or the SSH or serial console if the local realm is used for console access.

Instances of CWE-79 can be used to steal cookies, which are used for authentication.CWE-284: Improper Access ControlCommonSpot inconsistently enforces access control. Many pages can be used by an anonymous actor when accessed directly.CWE-285: Improper AuthorizationIn many cases, CommonSpot fails to authorize users before taking potentially-dangerous actions.CWE-73: External Control of File Name or PathSome pages that are provided by CommonSpot accept parameters that are fully-qualified filesystem paths.CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')Some pages that use file names as parameters are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL CharacterSome pages may terminate an attacker-provided string to be terminated earlier than expected. When combined with CWE-22, this can allow for control of a file path on the same drive as the ColdFusion web root.CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side SecuritySeveral unsafe CommonSpot operations are restricted on the client side using JavaScript. Because client-side JavaScript is under attacker control, these restrictions are not properly enforced.CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous TypeCommonSpot can allow authenticated users to upload arbitrary ColdFusion pages, which can allow arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the ColdFusion service.CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web ParameterMany CommonSpot pages use ColdFusion variables that can be overriden via the URI (HTTP GET).CWE-200: Information ExposureSeveral CommonSpot pages disclose sensitive information about the server, including server name, filesystem paths, SQL server type and DSNs, administrative email and SMTP server address.CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive InformationCommonSpot by default stores cleartext credentials in its database. Note that this behavior is documented, and it is possible to enable encryption.CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive InformationThe login pages used by CommonSpot transmit credentials in cleartext. If a CommonSpot server is administered over an untrusted network, the administrative credentials may be observed by an attacker.CWE-548: Information Exposure Through Directory ListingSome CommonSpot pages expose the ability to obtain an arbitrary directory listing.CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log FilesCommonSpot exposes unauthenticated access to its log file directory. If an attacker accesses a guessable file name, additional information about the server can be exposed.CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')CommonSpot allows for unauthenticated arbitrary command execution with arbitrary parameters. This command execution happens with the privileges of the ColdFusion service.",
        "impact": "Depending on the vulnerabilities exploited, a remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a variety of impacts, up to and including remote code execution on the CommonSpot / ColdFusion server with SYSTEM privileges."

When wget is running in recursive mode (the -m or -r switch) with a FTP server as the destination, it is vulnerable to a link following attack. A malicious FTP server, when configured to provide symlinks in the directory listing, can force the client wget utility to enter into the the specified local symlink, navigating the local file system for the attacker. Wget will then download and create or overwrite existing files within the local symlink, setting permissions to those of the remote files.See the Rapid7 advisory for more details.",
        "impact": "A remote unauthenticated malicious FTP server, connected to the victim via wget, can create and overwrite arbitrary files in the context of the user running wget."

Additional resources added and vendor patch information updated.CWE-78: OS Command InjectionBash supports exporting of shell functions to other instances of bash using an environment variable. This environment variable is named by the function name and starts with a \"() {\" as the variable value in the function definition. When Bash reaches the end of the function definition, rather than ending execution it continues to process shell commands written after the end of the function. This vulnerability is especially critical because Bash is widespread on many types of devices (UNIX-like operating systems including Linux and Mac OS X), and because many network services utilize Bash, causing the vulnerability to be network exploitable. Any service or program that sets environment variables controlled by an attacker and calls Bash may be vulnerable.Red Hat has developed the following test:$ env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c \"echo this is a test\"The website shellshocker.net from the health IT team at Medical Informatics Engineering has developed several tests for websites and hosts and includes update information.

        "description": "The HTTP TRACE method asks a web server to echo the contents of the request back to the client for debugging purposes. The HTTP TRACE method is described in the HTTP 1.1 standard (RFC 2616, section 9.8):9.8 TRACE The TRACE method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop- back of the request message. The final recipient of the request SHOULD reflect the message received back to the client as the entity-body of a 200 (OK) response. ... If the request is valid, the response SHOULD contain the entire request message in the entity-body, with a Content-Type of \"message/http\". Responses to this method MUST NOT be cached.As defined above, the complete request, including HTTP headers, is returned in the entity-body of a TRACE response. Using features that provide client-side HTTP protocol support, such as XMLHTTP ActiveX or XMLDOM scripting objects, a web site can cause browsers to issue TRACE requests. The site can read the TRACE response, including sensitive header information such as cookies or authentication data.When combined with cross-domain browser vulnerabilities (VU#244729, VU#711843, VU#728563), HTTP TRACE and client-side HTTP support can be leveraged by attackers to read sensitive header information from third-party domains. This technique has been termed \"Cross-Site Tracing,\" or XST, in a report published by WhiteHat Security. As noted in the report, the technique can be used to bypass the HttpOnly cookie attribute introduced in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1. HttpOnly blocks script access to the cookie property (document.cookie), but does not prevent a scripting object from reading the cookie out of an HTTP TRACE response.",
