It is not a problem if you are not using ACLs; also, it is partially mitigated by the fact that any domain that does not trigger an event in the timeframe where the attacker maintains their event callback will not be leaked.Once an attacker has learned about a domain by bypassing domain:getattr, they could perform other actions on the domain if there were not ACLs to filter those actions too, such as starting and stopping the domain."

Please notethat I was not able to crash the zarafa-server daemon using official upstreamZarafa binary packages just all community builds from the source code such as shipped in Fedora. This different behaviour might be caused that upstream usesdifferent built-time flags or other system libraries and headers.Once the zarafa-server process crashes with a backtrace (and even all otherZarafa related daemons are still running) there is no Zarafa functionality tillzarafa-server daemon is started again. The zarafa-server process provides theMAPI in SOAP service required by all other Zarafa related components as shown:http://doc.zarafa.com/trunk/Administrator_Manual/en-US/html/_architecture.html"

Assuming CFME is running on cfme.host and client's browsersent referer without a full path during authentication, attacker can mount CSRFfrom domain cfme.host.evil.com, which will bypass CSRF referer check.Code in the request_referer_service.rb contains following:class RequestRefererService def referer_valid?(referer, string_to_test) referer.to_s.starts_with?(string_to_test) endendThis check only makes sure that referer starts with string_to_test, with theassumption that it is FQDN of CFME host. String to test is set inDashboardController in authenticate action:538: session['referer'] = request.referer.sub(/\\?.*/,'')When user first authenticates, CFME saves the referer. Login form, from whichuser fires off authenticate request, is located at the root, so referer shouldcontain URL in form \"https://cfme.host/\". This is stripped from any parametersand saved to session['referer'], which will again contain \"https://cfme.host/\"for the rest of the session. Any subsequent user requests must include refererstarting with \"https://cfme.host/\".Sending referer header raises privacy concerns. To mitigate them, referer sentby the client may not include full URL, but only protocol+hostname instead offull path. This is exactly idea behind original proposal of Origin header (fordetails see [1]). Stripping full URL to hostname (or just domain) can beachieved by for example by Referer Control addon to Firefox, or perhapsimplemented at network level as a part of company security policy.If the client sends authenticate request without trailing \"/\", thensession['referer'] will contain something like \"https://cfme.host\", or just\"cfme.host\", and attacker can simply mount CSRF from \"cfme.host.evil.com\" andpass the check.This attack on broken Referer check implementation is described in OWASP CSRFprevention cheat sheet [2].Thank you.[1] http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/csrf/csrf.pdf[2] https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Checking_The_Referer_Header"

The only solution was to kill -9 this process and restart it. It was occuring randomly, so was quite hard to troubleshoot, but after a few hours, I've finaly identified what's causing it (well at least, I know a simple request from a client is enough to trigger it)I'll attach:- a strace of the process at the time the problem occure. In this file the last lines (recvfrom(12, 0xbfcff9c8, 576, 0, 0xbfcffc08, 0xbfcff988) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)) is repeated indefinitly as long as the process isn't killed, producing several GB per hour in the strace file. I've truncated it to the interesting part- a pcap of the packet crashing nmbd (which you can replay with tcpreplay to reproduce the issue)Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):How reproducible:100% with the attached pcapSteps to Reproduce:1. You need a client with IP 192.168.7.50 and MAC 6c:62:6d:b0:25:422. The server running nmbd with IP 192.168.7.1 and MAC 52:54:00:7C:31:C4(if you have different values you'll have to tweak the pcap with tcprewrite)3. The netbios name of the samba server should be SAS (it's contained in the pcap and needs to match the netbios name of the server in order to trigger the issue)4. Run nmbd (I'm running it with daemontools with /usr/sbin/nmbd -F -S but that probably doesn't matter)5. Replay the attached pcap with tcpreplay -i eth0 nmbd_dos.pcapActual results:nmbd will go in a loop, taking 100% of a core, and won't respond to any further requests, making impossible to login on the domainExpected results:nmbd should continue working as normalAdditional info:Marking this a security issue as it makes it very easy to DOS a domain controler"

For instance: user -> posix_group1 -> non_posix_group -> posix_group2With the group memberships noted above, SSSD should include the user as a member of both posix_group1 and posix_group2, however due to the position of the non-POSIX group, SSSD halts processing at it and never reaches posix_group2, leaving the user as a member of posix_group1 and not posix_group2.SSSD has the capability to set a 'deny' ACL for both users and groups, so in a situation like that illustrated above, if posix_group2 was present in a 'deny' ACL, the user would be granted access because they are not shown as having membership in the denied group. This could grant unintended access to certain users in an environment where non-POSIX groups are used in addition to POSIX groups.There is currently no patch to correct this issue.[1] https://lists.fedorahosted.org/pipermail/sssd-devel/2014-May/019495.htmlAcknowledgements:This issue was discovered by Arpit Tolani of Red Hat, with the security implications raised by Stephen Gallagher of Red Hat."

        "description": "Description Vincent Danen 2014-07-23 13:33:16 UTC As reported to the exim user's mailing list [1], Exim suffers from a local vulnerability where a string expansion is evaluated twice. If a local attacker were able to provide unsanitized data to a data source used by Exim for looking up a value, in certain situations, the data would be eval()'d twice. This is not remotely exploitable and requires a user account on the Exim server, and an Exim configuration that does lookups against files to which the user has edit access. The end result is that, if the conditions are true, arbitrary code could be executed as the exim user. As described in the posting:\"\"\"The root cause of this issue is the arguments to mathematical comparison operations are expanded twice (<, <=, >, >=, =). The intent of the original code was the first expansion could (for example) lookup an item from a file. The assumption was that entry would be some form of valid integer so that value was then passed to the expand function again to do a numeric conversion of values such as 19k or 45M to integers. However, if the content of the lookup is under direct user control, they could insert something with an expansion, such as: ${run {/bin/touch /tmp/OUCH}} Since the data is not sanitized when the second expansion occurs (intended to process numerical conversion), that command would get executed as the exim user. \"\"\"This is corrected in the Exim 4.83 release [2],[3],[4]. From the description, it looks as though every version of Exim released since 2004 is affected.[1] https://lists.exim.org/lurker/message/20140722.152452.d6c019e8.en.html[2] http://git.exim.org/exim.git/blob/exim-4_83:/doc/doc-txt/ChangeLog[3] http://git.exim.org/exim.git/commitdiff/7685ce68148a083d7759e78d01aa5198fc099c44[4] http://git.exim.org/exim.git/commitdiff/0de7239e563eff6e83c3e72d7deb9fd26a54a3a7"

This buffer is getting (re)allocated at line 831 like this:if (gpgsm->colon.attic.linesize < *alinelen + linelen + 1) { char *newline = realloc (*aline, *alinelen + linelen + 1); gpgsm->colon.attic.linesize += linelen + 1;...So in other words, the code allocates a buffer to be *alinelen + linelen + 1 bytes long, but then thinks its capacity is actually linesize + linelen + 1. This assumption is wrong if *alinelen (the number of bytes used in the buffer prior to reallocation) is lower than linesize (the total length of the buffer), or in other words, if the buffer is not completely full.In that case, a fragment of the input line is subsequently written past the end of the buffer at line 856:*dst = *src++;I'm not sure if it is really exploitable, but in general this routine is processing arbitrary data coming from certificates the user happens to encounter somehow, so one could possibly exploit this using specially crafted certificate or something like that.Attached is a trivial patch fixing the issue (works fine for me during daily use of KMail with e-mail signing/encryption).Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):gpgme-1.3.2-4.fc20.x86_64How reproducible:Perfectly reproducible for me, but as the bug is data-dependent and I'm not going to publish my keys, I don't have a simple testcase.

The index value is then used directly as an index to an arrayin the C code; internally the address of the array and its index areadded to each other in order to yield the address of the value that isdesired. However, by supplying a negative index value and adding thisto the address of the array, the processor's register value wrapsaround and the calculated value will point to a position in memorywhich isn't within the bounds of the supplied string, causing thefunction to access other parts of the process memory....Upstream bug report with additional technical details:[1] http://bugs.python.org/issue21529Upstream commits (taken from upstream tracker):2.7: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/50c07ed1743d3.1: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/a8facac493ef3.2: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/8130b8c066063.3: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/4f15bd1ab28f3.4: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/7b95540ced5c3.5: http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/3a414c709f1f"

This is vulnerability affects all versions of Docker up to, but excluding version 1.3.The primary vector for an attack is by loading of untrusted images via ‘docker load’. Images downloaded from DockerHub or private registries cannot exploit this vulnerability.It is recommended that users upgrade to Docker engine 1.3.Users of older releases of docker are advised not to load untrusted images via ‘docker load’.

In order to fix CVE-2014-0103, Zarafa introduced constants PASSWORD_KEYand PASSWORD_IV in /etc/zarafa/webaccess-ajax/config.php (Zarafa WebAccess)and /etc/zarafa/webapp/config.php (Zarafa WebApp), both are the upstreampath names of a default installation, downstream names might be different.Both files have default permissions of root:root and 644, thus decryptionof the symmetric encrypted passwords in the on-disk PHP session files ispossible again (similar like initially described in CVE-2014-0103). AffectsZarafa WebAccess >= 7.1.10, Zarafa WebApp >= 1.6 beta.2. The log directory /var/log/zarafa/ is shipped by default with root:rootand 755 and all created log files by the Zarafa daemons have by defaultroot:root and 644. This is leaking (depending on the log level of the givenservice) only e.g. subject, sender/recipient, message-id, SMTP queue id ofin- and outbound e-mails but might be even a cleartext protocol dump ofIMAP, POP3, CalDAV and iCal as well (including possible credentials) to anylocal system user. Affects Zarafa >= 5.00.3. The directories /var/lib/zarafa-webaccess/tmp/ (Zarafa WebAccess) and/var/lib/zarafa-webapp/tmp/ (Zarafa WebApp) are read- and writable by theApache system user by default - but also world readable for local systemusers (e.g. apache:apache and 755 on RHEL). Thus all the temporary sessiondata such as uploaded e-mail attachments can be read-only accessed becauseall created files below previously mentioned directories have permissions644, too. Upstream path names changed over the time and releases. AffectsZarafa WebAccess >= 4.1, Zarafa WebApp (any version).4. The optional (but proprietary) license daemon /usr/bin/zarafa-licensedruns by default with root permissions, the subscription/license key is putinto '/etc/zarafa/license/*'. The license files are recommented (accordingupstream documentation) to be created using echo(1) which usually leads toroot:root and 644. But the parent directory /etc/zarafa/license/ is shippedby default with root:root and 755. As result the key files can be accessedand copied by any local system user. Affects Zarafa >= 4.1.\"\"[1] http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/444"

Binaries such as shotwell-video-thumbnailer run this function on untrusted input, which probably makes this bug fairly easy to exploit.How reproducible:This bug is always observable on e.g. shotwell-video-thumbnailer when building the binary with the buggy bindings with Address Sanitizer.Steps to Reproduce:1. Build Shotwell vith a vulnerable Vala version and -fsanitize=address C compiler flag2. Run \"shotwell-video-thumbnailer /home/user/any-video.webm\"3. Observe the crashAlternatively, you can observe shotwell-video-thumbnailer output garbage instead of valid thumbnails when built with the buggy bindings without Address Sanitizer.Additional info:A patch for the issue is available: https://git.gnome.org/browse/vala/commit/?id=3092537db65887e24a3d3e87a27caf9c5295e4f7The issue was fixed in vala git master but not identified as a security vulnerability until I've independently discovered it.To mitigate it, the patch above should be applied to the bindings and then all binaries using Gst.MapInfo() have to be rebuild with the fixed bindings.I'm going to submit the information about this bug to distros@openwall.org for CVE allocation, which means it will be disclosed on the 12th of January.

The internal date_from_ISO8601() function failed to check buffer boundary when copying input string to a local fixed sized buffer.http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=blob;f=ext/xmlrpc/libxmlrpc/xmlrpc.c;h=d82f270#l164This leads to a stack based buffer overflow. A PHP application that uses the PHP xmlrpc extension (in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, this extension is available via separate php-xmlrpc package) to implement an XML-RPC server (or client) could crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code while parsing a specially crafted XML-RPC request.This problem was fixed upstream in PHP version 5.2.7 via:http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commitdiff;h=c818d0dhttps://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=45226The actual impact of the fix was apparently not realized upstream, as the fix was only listed as a bug fix, rather than security fix, in the upstream ChangeLog:http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.2.7 Fixed bugs #45226, #18916 (xmlrpc_set_type() segfaults and wrong behavior with valid ISO8601 date string). (Jeff Lawsons)Impact of this issue is mitigated on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, where php packages are built with the Stack Protector protection, which lead to early detection of the overflow, leading to application abort before the overwritten saved instruction pointer is used. The php packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 are not built with the Stack Protector protection to mitigate the code execution impact.The php packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later, as well as php53 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are based on the fixed upstream version and were not affected by this issue."

Prior to this, every version of the package did not properly handle mutual authentication which means that the client did not verify that the user was communicating with a trusted server. The version which contains the fix is 0.6 and all prior versions are considered vulnerable. This bug, however, prevented the mutual authentication code from being executed, so it's possible that users think they're talking to a trusted server, but they're not. requests_kerberos/kerberos_.py Make certain that responses always pass through handle_other() to provide mutual authentication before returning them to the user. 0.6: 2014-11-04 Handle mutual authentication (see pull request 36)"

This could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges if the <changeowner> configuration was used.The following fix was added to icecast version 2.4.0:In case of <changeowner> only UID and GID were changed, supplementary groups were left in place. This is a potential security issue only if <changeowner> is used. New behaviour is to set UID, GID and set supplementary groups based on the UID Even in case of icecast remaining in supplementary group 0 this \"only\" gives it things like access to files that are owned by group 0 and according to their umask. This is obviously bad, but not as bad as UID 0 with all its other special rights.
