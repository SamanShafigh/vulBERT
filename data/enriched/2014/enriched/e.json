An attacker able to man-in-the-middle a HTTP request to an apt repository can trigger the buffer overflow, leading to a crash of the http apt method binary, or potentially to arbitrary code execution. Two regression fixes were included in this update: Fix regression from the previous update in DSA-3025-1 when the custom apt configuration option for Dir::state::lists is set to a relative path (#762160). Fix regression in the reverification handling of cdrom: sources that may lead to incorrect hashsum warnings. Affected users need to run \"apt-cdrom add\" again after the update was applied. For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in version 0.9.7.9+deb7u5. We recommend that you upgrade your apt packages."
