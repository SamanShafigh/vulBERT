This can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault), or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. Because the X server runs as setuid root in many configurations, an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability in those configurations to gain root privileges.To install an ARGB cursor, an application would require a connection to a running X server. Normally, X servers are configured to only accept authenticated connections from the local host, but some X servers may be configured to more permissively allow connections, and/or to allow connections over a network.\"NoScanout\" mode is enabled implicitly on NVIDIA products which lack display output connectors, and can be enabled explicitly on some other configurations with the X configuration option:Option \"UseDisplayDevice\" \"none\"NVIDIA GPU drivers for OSes other than Linux, FreeBSD, VMware ESX, and Solaris are not affected.This vulnerability has been present since NVIDIA driver version 195.22. The overflow is fixed in 304.88, 310.44, 313.30, and all drivers newer than those versions.NVIDIA recommends that users upgrade to a fixed driver version, or disable NoScanout mode, where possible.This vulnerability was identified by NVIDIA.

Faircom formerly described this algorithm as follows:FairCom Standard EncryptionUsing our standard proprietary encryption algorithm provides the means to add an extra level of confidentiality to an application’s data. FairCom designed its proprietary encryption algorithm for speed and efficiency, focusing on minimizing performance loss.The encryption algorithm is proprietary to FairCom Corporation and the details are not released in any way to increase the difficulty of reverse-engineering the process. While reverse-engineering is a violation of the licensing agreement, it remains a remote possibility, and FairCom does everything possible to limit the potential exposure of the FairCom algorithms.This Standard File Encryption is not intended as a replacement for OS or other security systems, however, as a supplement to existing security. Standard File Encryption is suitable for most needs with excellent security vs. performance tradeoffs.Faircom has come up with a new branding called \"Data Camouflage\" so it will be less likely to be confused with standard encryption algorithms, such as, AES. Faircom describes the \"Data Camouflage\" algorithm as follows:Data CamouflageUsing our Data Camouflage technique provides the means to add an extra level of confidentiality to an application’s data. FairCom designed this approach to mask the file on the disk without sacrificing speed and efficiency, focusing on minimizing performance loss.Data Camouflage is not intended as a replacement for OS or other security systems, however, as a supplement to existing security. It is suitable for most needs with excellent security vs. performance tradeoffs. With this approach, you can protect data on disk from unauthorized inspection, but any c-treeACE client can access the protected files. To avoid this, the Advanced File Encryption option includes the ability to have hidden keys. Proper implementation of user access controls within c-treeACE is also recommend to prevent unauthorized access to data, even it not masked with the Data Camouflage feature.An attacker that is able to obtain a c-treeACE database that is obfuscated using the Data Camouflage algorithm (formerly Faircom Standard Encryption) may be able to unobfuscate the database by moving it to a trial install of c-treeACE, deleting the .fcs configuration files and replacing the .fcs files with the default files from the trial. This will allow the attacker to authenticate to the database with default ADMIN/ADMIN credentials and view the contents of the obfuscated database.",

        "overview": "By observing the length of compressed HTTPS responses, an attacker may be able to derive plaintext secrets from the ciphertext of an HTTPS stream.",
        "description": "Angelo Prado of Salesforce.com reports:Extending the CRIME vulnerability presented at Ekoparty 2012, an attacker can target HTTPS responses to recover data from the response body.While the CRIME attack is currently believed to be mitigated by disabling TLS/SSL/level compression, compressed HTTP responses represent a significant unmitigated vector which is currently exploitable. By injecting plaintext into an HTTPS request, an attacker can learn information about the corresponding HTTPS response by measuring its size.This relies on the attacker being able to observe the size of the cipher text received by the browser while triggering a number of strategically crafted requests to a target site. To recover a particular secret in an HTTPS response body, the attacker guesses character by character, sending a pair of requests for each guess. The correct guess will result in a smaller HTTPS response. For each guess the attacker coerces the victim's browser to issue two requests. The first request includes a payload of the form:\"target_secret_name=<already known part of secret>+<guess>+<padding>\" ...while the second request includes a payload of the form: \"target_secret_name=<already known part of secret>+<padding>+<guess>\". If the size of the first response is smaller than the second response, this indicates that the guess has a good chance of being correct. This method of sending two similar requests and comparing them is due to Duong and Rizzo. If multiple candidates are found, the following is a useful recovery mechanism: move forward in parallel with both candidates until it becomes clear which guess is correct. With a token of length 32 and a character space of size 16 (e.g. hex), the attacker needs an average of approximately 1,000 request if no recovery mechanisms are needed. In practice, we have been able to recover CSRF tokens with fewer than 4,000 requests. A browser like Google Chrome or Internet Explorer is able to issue this number of requests in under 30 seconds, including callbacks to the attacker command & control center.[In order to conduct the attack, the following conditions must be true]:HTTPS-enabled endpoint (ideally with stream ciphers like RC4, although the attack can be made to work with adaptive padding for block ciphers).The attacker must be able to measure the size of HTTPS responses.

Once compromised the device can be used to eavesdrop on voice, text and data communication for mobile devices that connect to the Network Extender.",
        "description": "The iSEC Partners Security Advisory - 2012-003-verizon states:The Verizon Wireless Network Extender is a low-power cellular base station. It is given or sold to subscribers by mobile network operators, and works like a small cell tower, using a home Internet connection to interface with the provider network. When in range, a mobile phone will connect to a femtocell as if it were a standard cell tower. Two versions of the Network Extender were tested: the Samsung SCS-26UC4 and SCS-2U01. The Network Extender is susceptible to a number of vulnerabilities that allow console access to the device as root, using a custom HDMI cable. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to a total compromise of the device, including running custom code and eavesdropping on voice, text and data communication. An additional vulnerability exists in the CDMA authentication code that allows cloning of a subscriber's phone.SCS-26UC4 Root Exploit:-----------------------The older hardware version of the Network Extender is designated \"SCS-26UC4\".It is possible to exploit a built-in delay of the Uboot bootloader to obtain console access. To be able to exploit this vulnerability, a special console cable must be created with an HDMI connector to connect to the device. Once it is possible to view boot output, the following steps will present a root shell:1) While viewing the boot output, a prompt will display: \"Press any key to interrupt boot\"2) Type \"sys\" and press <enter>3) Disable the watchdog by typing: setenv watchdog_off 14) Update the ramboot environment variable by typing: setenv ramboot version\\;echo\\;setenv\\ bootargs\\ mem=64M\\ console=ttyS0\\,57600n8\\ root=/dev/ram0\\ init=/bin/sh\\;mdocboot5) Type \"boot\" and press <enter> to boot the kernel and obtain a root shell.SCS-2U01 Root Exploit:----------------------The newer hardware version of the Network Extender is designated \"SCS-2U01\".It is possible to obtain console access to the SCS-2U01 even though the Uboot delay has been removed, using the SysReq (System Request) interrupt. The actual key combination used to send a SysReq is dependent on the terminal emulator program used on the connected computer. If successfully applied, this command will halt boot process and drop the user to a login prompt, where it is possible to login as the root user. As with the previous exploit, it is first necessary to create a console cable to be able to view and send commands to the device.1) While viewing the boot output, wait until the device attempts to extract the RFS.2) Enter <SysReq> i(1) 3) All running processes will be terminated and a login prompt will display4) Log in with the root username and password to obtain a root shell. (Note: This password is the same for all systems and is freely available on the Internet)Lack of CAVE Authentication:----------------------------The Network Extender does not appear to use Cellular Authentication and Voice Encryption (CAVE). For cellular phone authentication, the device appears to only use the ESN and MIN. These numbers can usually be obtained with physical access to a phone, or by sniffing registration packets as they transit the Network Extender. Combining the above root access flaws with a lack of proper authentication, it is possible to run custom code on the Network Extender that will obtain the ESN and MIN from any phone within range. Using these numbers, a phone can be cloned without direct physical access and without a user's knowledge, although association to the Network Extender is required.Fix Information:----------------It may not be possible to completely secure this device from unauthorized use. However, it is certainly possible to harden the device and make it more difficult to exploit. A detailed analysis should be performed on all aspects of the device, including hardware design.Proposed fixes:---------------1) The Uboot delay flaw in the SCS-26UC4 has been addressed in the upgrade to the SCS-2U01. Depending on the expected operational lifetime of the SCS-26UC4, it may be appropriate to apply a fix to these devices or to plan to remove them from the network.2) The SysReq vulnerability can be fixed by disabling the kernel variable: /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq = 0. Note: this change should be made in the kernel at compile time, rather than set via sysctl variables.3) CAVE Authentication should be implemented on the Network Extender.4) Change the root password; the current password has been published on the Internet for some time. The new root password should be extremely strong and beyond the reach of even projected password cracking ability. For example, a 40-character alphanumeric lowercase/uppercase string with symbols would be more suitable.5) Consider adding an increased system monitoring capability or tamper protections that will provide the ability to detect possible exploitation attempts. For example, monitoring certain device errors or user logins may provide information on potential break-in attempts.The fixes proposed above will mitigate the specific vulnerabilities discovered, but may not greatly increase the overall security of the system. Hardening the device can only go so far, as the system architecture itself is flawed. Because users are in physical possession of the device, it may not be possible to harden the Network Extender to the extent where it cannot be effectively exploited while also allowing it to be usable and serviceable. As long as data from the cellular handset transiting the Network Extender is available in plaintext, it will be vulnerable - even if communication is secured between the Network Extender and the internal Verizon network. Require registration of subscribers phones to specific femtocells, and enforce this on Verizon's core network. Subscribers should only be able to connect to femtocells they have been securely registered with. This prevents attackers from deploying rogue femtocells to capture arbitrary subscribers in an area. However it may still be possible for attackers to bypass the registration by isolating a subscriber from the core network and simulating phone calls or text messages and receiving responses from the device.Encrypting the communication between the handset and the carrier network end-to-end would make it much safer from eavesdroppers anywhere along the network path, including at the Network Extender. If this model of secure communication were applied to all voice, text and data traffic on the handset, the Network Extender architecture could be made significantly more secure. In this scenario, if a determined attacker were able to compromise a hardened device, data loss would be much less severe, since the data is encrypted and equivalent to what the attacker could see by sniffing their own network. This does not preclude other attacks that can be performed on encrypted data, but is a stronger and defensible architecture given the current system design.iSEC Partners stated they contacted Verizon on December 7th, 2012 and Samsung on January 3rd, 2013 for a coordinated disclosure of these vulnerabilities.",

An additional vulnerability exists in the CDMA authentication code that allows cloning of a subscriber's phone.SCS-26UC4 Root Exploit:-----------------------The older hardware version of the Network Extender is designated \"SCS-26UC4\".It is possible to exploit a built-in delay of the Uboot bootloader to obtain console access. To be able to exploit this vulnerability, a special console cable must be created with an HDMI connector to connect to the device. Once it is possible to view boot output, the following steps will present a root shell:1) While viewing the boot output, a prompt will display: \"Press any key to interrupt boot\"2) Type \"sys\" and press <enter>3) Disable the watchdog by typing: setenv watchdog_off 14) Update the ramboot environment variable by typing: setenv ramboot version\\;echo\\;setenv\\ bootargs\\ mem=64M\\ console=ttyS0\\,57600n8\\ root=/dev/ram0\\ init=/bin/sh\\;mdocboot5) Type \"boot\" and press <enter> to boot the kernel and obtain a root shell.SCS-2U01 Root Exploit:----------------------The newer hardware version of the Network Extender is designated \"SCS-2U01\".It is possible to obtain console access to the SCS-2U01 even though the Uboot delay has been removed, using the SysReq (System Request) interrupt. The actual key combination used to send a SysReq is dependent on the terminal emulator program used on the connected computer. If successfully applied, this command will halt boot process and drop the user to a login prompt, where it is possible to login as the root user. As with the previous exploit, it is first necessary to create a console cable to be able to view and send commands to the device.1) While viewing the boot output, wait until the device attempts to extract the RFS.2) Enter <SysReq> i(1) 3) All running processes will be terminated and a login prompt will display4) Log in with the root username and password to obtain a root shell. (Note: This password is the same for all systems and is freely available on the Internet)Lack of CAVE Authentication:----------------------------The Network Extender does not appear to use Cellular Authentication and Voice Encryption (CAVE). For cellular phone authentication, the device appears to only use the ESN and MIN. These numbers can usually be obtained with physical access to a phone, or by sniffing registration packets as they transit the Network Extender. Combining the above root access flaws with a lack of proper authentication, it is possible to run custom code on the Network Extender that will obtain the ESN and MIN from any phone within range. Using these numbers, a phone can be cloned without direct physical access and without a user's knowledge, although association to the Network Extender is required.Fix Information:----------------It may not be possible to completely secure this device from unauthorized use. However, it is certainly possible to harden the device and make it more difficult to exploit. A detailed analysis should be performed on all aspects of the device, including hardware design.Proposed fixes:---------------1) The Uboot delay flaw in the SCS-26UC4 has been addressed in the upgrade to the SCS-2U01. Depending on the expected operational lifetime of the SCS-26UC4, it may be appropriate to apply a fix to these devices or to plan to remove them from the network.2) The SysReq vulnerability can be fixed by disabling the kernel variable: /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq = 0. Note: this change should be made in the kernel at compile time, rather than set via sysctl variables.3) CAVE Authentication should be implemented on the Network Extender.4) Change the root password; the current password has been published on the Internet for some time. The new root password should be extremely strong and beyond the reach of even projected password cracking ability. For example, a 40-character alphanumeric lowercase/uppercase string with symbols would be more suitable.5) Consider adding an increased system monitoring capability or tamper protections that will provide the ability to detect possible exploitation attempts. For example, monitoring certain device errors or user logins may provide information on potential break-in attempts.The fixes proposed above will mitigate the specific vulnerabilities discovered, but may not greatly increase the overall security of the system. Hardening the device can only go so far, as the system architecture itself is flawed. Because users are in physical possession of the device, it may not be possible to harden the Network Extender to the extent where it cannot be effectively exploited while also allowing it to be usable and serviceable. As long as data from the cellular handset transiting the Network Extender is available in plaintext, it will be vulnerable - even if communication is secured between the Network Extender and the internal Verizon network. Require registration of subscribers phones to specific femtocells, and enforce this on Verizon's core network. Subscribers should only be able to connect to femtocells they have been securely registered with. This prevents attackers from deploying rogue femtocells to capture arbitrary subscribers in an area. However it may still be possible for attackers to bypass the registration by isolating a subscriber from the core network and simulating phone calls or text messages and receiving responses from the device.Encrypting the communication between the handset and the carrier network end-to-end would make it much safer from eavesdroppers anywhere along the network path, including at the Network Extender. If this model of secure communication were applied to all voice, text and data traffic on the handset, the Network Extender architecture could be made significantly more secure. In this scenario, if a determined attacker were able to compromise a hardened device, data loss would be much less severe, since the data is encrypted and equivalent to what the attacker could see by sniffing their own network. This does not preclude other attacks that can be performed on encrypted data, but is a stronger and defensible architecture given the current system design.iSEC Partners stated they contacted Verizon on December 7th, 2012 and Samsung on January 3rd, 2013 for a coordinated disclosure of these vulnerabilities.",

As long as data from the cellular handset transiting the Network Extender is available in plaintext, it will be vulnerable - even if communication is secured between the Network Extender and the internal Verizon network. Require registration of subscribers phones to specific femtocells, and enforce this on Verizon's core network. Subscribers should only be able to connect to femtocells they have been securely registered with. This prevents attackers from deploying rogue femtocells to capture arbitrary subscribers in an area. However it may still be possible for attackers to bypass the registration by isolating a subscriber from the core network and simulating phone calls or text messages and receiving responses from the device.Encrypting the communication between the handset and the carrier network end-to-end would make it much safer from eavesdroppers anywhere along the network path, including at the Network Extender. If this model of secure communication were applied to all voice, text and data traffic on the handset, the Network Extender architecture could be made significantly more secure. In this scenario, if a determined attacker were able to compromise a hardened device, data loss would be much less severe, since the data is encrypted and equivalent to what the attacker could see by sniffing their own network. This does not preclude other attacks that can be performed on encrypted data, but is a stronger and defensible architecture given the current system design.iSEC Partners stated they contacted Verizon on December 7th, 2012 and Samsung on January 3rd, 2013 for a coordinated disclosure of these vulnerabilities.",
        "impact": "A local attacker using a custom HDMI cable may be able to compromise the Network Extender device to run custom code to enable the attacker to eavesdrop on voice, text and data communication for mobile devices that connect to the Network Extender."

Servers running the network time protocol (NTP) based on implementations of ntpd prior to version 4.2.7p26 that use the default unrestricted query configuration are susceptible to a reflected denial-of-service (DRDoS) attack. Other proprietary NTP implementations may also be affected. This is similar in scope to DNS Amplification Attacks.In a reflected denial-of-service attack, the attacker spoofs the source address of attack traffic, replacing the source address with the target's address. Certain NTP control messages provide significant bandwidth amplification factors (BAF).NTP is designed for time synchronization, and may also implement other features such as server administration, maintenance, and monitoring. NTP relies on the user datagram protocol (UDP) to send and receive messages, which does not validate the source (IP address) of the sender. The NTP DRDoS attack is similar to the reflective DoS attacks used on open DNS resolvers. The attacker sends a packet with their source address being the IP of a victim. The NTP server replies to this request, but the number of bytes sent in the response is an amplified amount compared to the initial request, resulting in a denial-of-service on the victim. The two highest message types, REQ_MON_GETLIST and REQ_MON_GETLIST_1 amplify the original request by a factor of up to 3660 and 5500 respectively. This bandwidth amplification factor (BAF) is a bandwidth multiplier based on the number of UDP payload bytes that are sent by the server in comparison to the UDP payload bytes of the request. Other message types can also be used in this attack, but REQ_MON_GETLIST and REQ_MON_GETLIST_1 create the biggest impact.This vulnerability contains elements of CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification).More information can be found in Christian Rossow's \"Amplification DDoS Attacks (Ab)using NTP Servers\" blog post.In April 2014, Rapid7 published R7-2014-12 documenting additional NTP commands that can amplify traffic and disclose potentially sensitive information.",

This has been remediated in Coursemill 6.8CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2013-3603In Coursemill 6.6, the application was observed to reflect error messages containing user-provided URL input directly to the browser without proper input validation and output encoding. This allows for a reflected XSS attack, whereby an attacker can pass a crafted link to a user which when clicked, executes malicious JavaScript to attack the user.This is partially remediated in Coursemill 6.8. The application is still vulnerable to reflected XSS due to insufficient input validation and output encoding. The application attempts to remove event attributes by keyword - anything with the letters “on” (such as “onmouseover”) are removed. This can be defeated by inserting null bytes (%00) in between the “o” and the “n” which will evade the filter and allow the browser to execute the script. The additional validation step of removing closing brackets (“>” ) is also insufficient because some browsers, such as Internet Explorer, will tolerate lack of closing brackets and execute the HTML regardless. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2013-3604In Coursemill 6.6 and 6.8, a stored XSS attack is possible in several application inputs. Coursemill 6.8 adds a filter for closing quotes, but does not filter other input (such as %22)CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2013-3605Coursemill 6.6 relies on cookie values to authenticate a request from a user, rendering it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Coursemill 6.8 adds CSRF tokens but they are constructed using predictable values (timestamps of the user).",

Mozilla Thunderbird blocks the creation of certain HTML elements, such as script, when displaying email messages. Traditionally, a script element is created through the use of a <script> HTML tag. HTML elements, including script, can also be created through the use of an <object> tag that specifies a Data URI scheme (RFC 2397). The Data URI can specify a text/html mime type and encode the script in base64. In such cases, Thunderbird will execute the script contained in the email message when it is forwarded or replied to and the outgoing message is in HTML format.

The observed behavior is that the user need only enter the one-time password generated by the security token; the product will successfully authenticate the user when no Active Directory password is provided.
