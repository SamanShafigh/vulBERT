        "description": "Description Kurt Seifried 2013-01-09 05:35:29 UTC Michael Scherer (misc@zarb.org) of Red Hat reports:Looking at a recent git checkout of openshift, I found that some script use a hardcoded or easy to guess filename in /tmp, in this case :https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/port-proxy/bin/openshift-port-proxy-cfg#L13I am not sure this can be exploited, but after searching a while, here is a credible attack.This filename is used on https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/port-proxy/bin/openshift-port-proxy-cfg#L144While it took me a while to figure what the code of lockwrap does exactly, I found out there is a small windows of time between \"we check the file exist and is empty\" and \"we write 0 or a return code to the file\". Let's imagine the following scenario, some attacker has shell access to the server that run this ( ie, a openshift node if I am not wrong ). People have access to the node, at least on openshift-online and this is required to push with git the code ( unless setup otherwise ).This attacker create 5000 empty files who match the pattern /tmp/openshift-port-proxy-reload.req.????? ( and this could be something else than numbers, like .aaaaa ). Then he wait, and 1 second after, erase it and replace it by a link to another arbitrary file. Doing it with the 5000 files and a proper timing ( like waiting 1/5000 second between each file operation )would make sure that if a operation check a file and then 1 second later, write to the file, this would not be the same for at least 1 of them. ( atleast, that's my understanding, timing may be harder to get right on a real computer with enough ram, cpu and fast disk than the one I imagined ). Another variant would be to use something that is triggered when stat is run, but inotify cannot be used, and audit subsystem requires root.Then, if someone else run the script and enter the function lockwrap that reload the proxy, it would first do a stat to check the file is empty (https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/port-proxy/bin/openshift-port-proxy-cfg#L152) then reload the proxy ( and check all others file with stat before ), and there is a non negligeable chance that the script would write the return code in a different file ( ie, if that's a link, write it somewhere else ), since it write on all files matching the pattern, and not only the one created by mkstemp. Depending on the kernel configuration and installation, this can be mitigated ( openshift online use polyinstanciation of /tmp, for example, newer kernel ship the yama module, for another example ). But in the most favourable case for the attacker ( ie no protection ), this mean he can create a file in a arbitray location with a content of 0 or 1.The script is executed as root , as part as the user creation :https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/node/lib/openshift-origin-node/model/unix_user.rb#L87 , function create, just after running useradd command ( hence the assumption this is run as root ) that function call initialize_openshift_port_proxy https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/node/lib/openshift-origin-node/model/unix_user.rb#L139that run the command \"openshift-port-proxy-cfg setproxy\" https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/node/lib/openshift-origin-node/model/unix_user.rb#L583that then that script run the function lockwrap :https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/port-proxy/bin/openshift-port-proxy-cfg#L263and then lockwrap trigger the problem described before.So a attacker could just create and remove several application until the attack succeed, ie, bruteforce it and make a 0 or 1 be written in a arbitrary location as root ( if selinux, polyinstanciation etc are disabled ).openshift-origin-port-proxy is part of the entreprise release version 1, IIRC,of F18 and rawhide. So I think this will requires a errata and a CVE if I am not wrong on my analysis of the problem. The issue was not discussed with anyone explicitely (I just discussed about the code on #fedora-devel on irc.freenode.net with 2 others fedora packagers but the exact issue was not disclosed )."

Since it use $$, the name could be predicted or a for loop could be used to bruteforce it ( by creating several file with potential filename, as there is just )There is several issue with this approach :- the mkdir -p use a predictable filename. Someone could create several link with a loop, and then the script would jump in, since the return code of mkdir is not checked. So if I create a link /tmp/mondogodbdump.$$ to a directory I control ( so with 777 permission ), I could trick someone into running a dump and potentially steal the information. As this would be dumped in a directory I control and I can read, depending on the umask used, it may end readable by the attacker.- pushd do not check at all if the file is a directory. So if there is a file /tmp/mongodump.1234 , then pushd would silently fail, and then create the dump ( and run the tar.gz creation command from current directory, or worst, from a directory decided by the attacker. There, a attacker could inject some fake table in bson format to the archive. Depending on the application, this could be a building block for a more specialized attack. While it would surely do no harm on openshift online ( due to polyinstanciation and selinux , I think this could cause potential issues if someone didn't use selinux to properly separate the users ( ie, someone using openshift without following all the recommendation for deployment ).- rm -Rf /tmp/mongodbdump.$$ doesn't sound great either, depending on the uid of the user running the script, and depending on where a potential link would be point too. Again, openshift online should not suffer from the problem, based on what I know of the architecture. But someone could be tricked into erasing the project directory, or worst.- if mongodb try to dump and cannot write a file, it crash ( segfault, reported as 892035 ). While this is not related to that, it could be used for some dos attack by filling the harddrive"

If \"s\" is larger than MAX_INT, it will not be set to \"zip->remaining_data_bytes\" even though it is larger than \"zip->remaining_data_bytes\", which leads to a buffer overflow when calling deflate().This can lead to a segfault in an application that uses libarchive to create ZIP archives."

        "description": "Description Vincent Danen 2013-02-13 22:54:47 UTC Kaushik Banerjee discovered that SSSD's \"simple\" access provider did not work as expected when SSSD is configured as an Active Directory client when using the new (as of version 1.9.0) Active Directory provider. During the PAM account phase, SSSD may not not know the group name of a group that the user is a member of, but only the Windows Security Identifier. Because the group name is not known, the simple_deny_groups option does not work at all, and will always permit access; if any groups are noted in simple_deny_groups, all groups are permitted access. In addition, if any groups are noted in simple_allow_groups, access is always denied to everyone.By default, the configuration will allow all users to login (both simple_deny_groups and simple_allow_groups are empty).The Active Directory provider was introduced in version 1.9.0; earlier versions of SSSD are not vulnerable to this flaw.Acknowledgements:This issue was discovered by Kaushik Banerjee of Red Hat."

This happens becausekrb5_walk_realm_tree() returns a list of length one when it attemptsto construct a transit path between a single-component realm and theempty-string realm. This list causes a loop in find_alternate_tgs()to iterate over zero elements, resulting in the unexpected output of anull pointer, which process_tgs_req() proceeds to dereference becausethere is no error condition.Add an error condition to find_referral_tgs() whenkrb5_get_host_realm() returns an empty realm name.

The terminal-specific time stamp file behavior can be controlled using the \"tty_tickets\" option in the sudoers file. This option has been enabled by default since sudo 1.7.4. Prior to sudo 1.7.4, the default was to use a single time stamp for all the user's sessions.A vulnerability exists because the user can control which terminal the standard input, output and error file descriptors (0-2) refer to. A malicious user could use this to run commands via sudo without authenticating, so long as there exists a terminal the user has access to where a sudo command was successfully run by that same user within the password timeout period (usually five minutes).The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other than those allowed by the sudoers policy.This affects versions 1.3.5 through up to the fixed 1.7.10p6 version, and sudo 1.8.0 through to the fixed 1.8.7p7.The fix for 1.7.x: http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/0c0283d1fafaThe fix for 1.8.x: http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/049a12a5cc14External References:http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/tty_tickets.html"

Because of this, if a user where able to poison DNS to a victim's computer, they would be able to trick rpc.gssd into talking to another server (perhaps with less security) than the intended server (with stricter security). If the victim has write access to the second (less secure) server, and the attacker has read access (when they normally might not on the secure server), the victim could write files to that server, which the attacker could obtain (when normally they would not be able to). To the victim this is transparent because the victim's computer asks the KDC for a ticket to the second server due to reverse DNS resolution; in this case Krb5 authentication does not fail because the victim is talking to the \"correct\" server.A patch that prevents this issue has been posted [3].To workaround this issue, set the IP/host pair in /etc/hosts so that it cannot be spoofed.A good explanation is also available here [4].[1] http://marc.info/?l=linux-nfs&m=136491998607561&w=2[2] http://marc.info/?l=linux-nfs&m=136500502805121&w=2[3] http://marc.info/?l=linux-nfs&m=136493115612397&w=2[4] http://ssimo.org/blog/id_015.html"

These records can contain an IPsec gatewayspecification containing an fully qualified hostname which is passed toa function atoid().When X.509 support was added to FreeS/WAN, ASN.1 parsing was added tothe function atoid() which converts an ASCII ID representation into aninternal struct id representation using a static buffer via the functiontemporary_cyclic_buffer()While DNS TXT records cannot contain ASN.1 representations, the codemistakenly checked for such interpretation if the DNS TXT FQDN containedan '=' symbol. Since DNS TXT buffers can be larger than what the ASN.1parsing code expected, parsing such a record can trigger a buffer overflowleading to remote execution of code, specifically when overflowing into thestruct kernel_ops which is a table of function pointers.Exploitation:This exploit can only be triggered when the ipsec.conf configuration fileenables Opportunistic Encryption via the option 'oe=yes'. If this option isnot present, it defaults to 'no'.Configurations that enable \"OE\" without preconfiguring their own public RSAkey in DNS will be under severe connectivity problems leaving the machinewith 30 second delay for each outgoing connection - a deployment scenario thatis extremely unlikely to appear in the wild.In the unlikely event that machines are configured as such, thisvulnerability can only be exploited by a remote attacker controlling thereverse DNS entry for the IP address of the targetted host. If the machine isproperly configured for OE, an attacker only needs to trigger a connection toan IP address for which they control the reverse DNS zone where they can placethe malicious DNS record.Credits:This vulnerability was found by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat ProductSecurity Team (https://access.redhat.com/security/team/)"

Plaintext recovery may be possible using a padding oracle attack on the CBC mode cipher implementation of the crypto library, optimistically at a rate of about one character per 3 hours. PolarSSL seems vulnerable to such an attack; the vulnerability of OpenSSL has not been verified or tested.OpenVPN servers are typically configured to silently drop packets with the wrong HMAC. For this reason measuring the processing time of the packets is not trivial without a MITM position. In practice, the attack likely needs some target-specific information to be effective.The severity of this vulnerability can be considered low. Only if OpenVPN is configured to use a null-cipher, arbitrary plain-text can be injected which can completely open up this attack vector.A fix has been committed to git [2]; this is corrected in OpenVPN 2.3.1 and later.[1] https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/SecurityAnnouncement-f375aa67cc[2] https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/commit/11d21349a4e7e38a025849479b36ace7c2eec2ee"

If a configuration makes use of one of the following functions : - hdr_ip(<name>, <value>) (in 1.4) - hdr_*(<name>, <value>) (in 1.5)with a negative <value>, then the configuration risks to crash when therequest contains exactly MAX_HDR_HISTORY values for the header <name>.Note: \"source 0.0.0.0 usesrc hdr_ip(<name>)\" uses -1 by default for <value>and is vulnerable as well !The quick workaround I can suggest before patching is to reject dangerousrequests early using hdr_cnt(<name>), which is available both in 1.4 and 1.5 : block if { hdr_cnt(<name>) ge 10 }Thus, I'm going to issue 1.5-dev19 and 1.4.24 with the following patch applied.1.5-dev has not received significant updates recently and is of very littlerisk when migrating from dev17 or dev18.The new version will probably be finished during the week-end with an announceon Monday morning european time.

Thus we can dereference the array with a negativenumber and randomly crash the process.This bug has been present since the introduction of the negative offsetcount in 1.4.4 via commit bce70882. It has been reported by David Torgersonwho offered some debugging traces showing where the crash happened, thusmaking it significantly easier to find the bug!This fix must absolutely be backported to 1.4."

        "title": "CVE-2013-3587 BREACH attack against HTTP compression",
        "description": "Description Vincent Danen 2013-08-08 17:22:35 UTC Angelo Prado, Neal Harris and Yoel Gluck reported [1],[2] that SSL/TLS attacks are still viable via a \"BREACH\" (Browser Reconnaissance & Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext) attack, which they describe as:While CRIME was mitigated by disabling TLS/SPDY compression (and by modifying gzip to allow for explicit separation of compression contexts in SPDY), BREACH attacks HTTP responses. These are compressed using the common HTTP compression, which is much more common than TLS-level compression. This allows essentially the same attack demonstrated by Duong and Rizzo, but without relying on TLS-level compression (as they anticipated).BREACH is a category of vulnerabilities and not a specific instance affecting a specific piece of software. To be vulnerable, a web application must:* Be served from a server that uses HTTP-level compression* Reflect user-input in HTTP response bodies* Reflect a secret (such as a CSRF token) in HTTP response bodiesIt is important to note that the attack is agnostic to the version of TLS/SSL, and does not require TLS-layer compression. Additionally, the attack works against any cipher suite. Against a stream cipher, the attack is simpler; the difference in sizes across response bodies is much more granular in this case. If a block cipher is used, additional work must be done to align the output to the cipher text blocks.CERT has an entry describing the flaw as well [3]. Currently no CVE is assigned as MITRE is attempting to determine whether one CVE will suffice, or whether it will require multiple CVEs (one per affected product). [4]Mitigations are noted by the researchers as follows1. Disable HTTP compression.2. Separate the secrets from the user input.3. Randomize the secrets in each client request.4. Mask secrets (effectively randomizing by XORing with a random secret per request).5. Protect web pages from CSRF attacks.6. Obfuscate the length of web responses by adding random amounts of arbitrary bytes.[1] http://breachattack.com/[2] http://breachattack.com/resources/BREACH%20-%20SSL,%20gone%20in%2030%20seconds.pdf[3] http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/987798[4] http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/08/07/1"

Extension#value depends OpenSSL function X509V3_EXT_print() and for dNSName of subjectAltName it utilizes sprintf() that is known as null byte unsafe. As the result Extension#value returns ‘www.ruby-lang.org’ if the subjectAltName is ‘www.ruby-lang.org\\0.example.com’ and OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity wrongly identifies the certificate is for ‘www.ruby-lang.org’.When a CA a SSL client trusts allows to issue the server certificate that has null byte in subjectAltName, remote attackers can obtain the certificate for ‘www.ruby-lang.org\\0.example.com’ from the CA to spoof ‘www.ruby-lang.org’ and do man-in-the-middle between Ruby’s SSL client and SSL servers.External References:http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/06/27/hostname-check-bypassing-vulnerability-in-openssl-client-cve-2013-4073/"

This looks like a security issue to me, thus marking it as such and reporting it. If you disagree, feel free to change that.In the gpg manpage there's an explanation about how userid can be selected, and for example: By exact match on an email address. This is indicated by enclosing the email address in the usual way with left and right angles. <heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de>So the angles should be added to the command line used by Evolution.Note that this still won't work if multiple keys match that email address. Maybe Evolution should do the same as mutt, which seems to first search (using I guess gpg --list) the keys matching a query, then ask the user to select the uid. This would make sure the user actually knows to what recipient the mail is encrypted to.And also note that, right now, there's no way to encrypt the mail to the correct recipient but to delete the key from the keyring.Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):Evolution 3.8.2How reproducible: AlwaysSteps to Reproduce:1. create keys for multiple recipient with matching email addresses (test@example.com and foo-test@example.com)2. try to write gpg encrypted mail to both addressesActual results:Mail is always encrypted to the first matching user id."

The problem lies in the use of dangerous functions like scanf and sprintf to handle user input.I have contacted the Little CMS developer and his answer was that \"people concerned about security should update to Little CMS v2\". To be honest I think it's a reasonable answer since he has stopped supporting lcms-1 in 2009. However this appears to be a package that is still widely in use in several distributions, and included in other software as a library.I am attaching patches here to address the issue.

Key flags are the packets, that indicated the capabilities of the key, represented as binary flags. The issue is that if a key or subkey has this \"key flags\" subpacket attached with all bits cleared (off), GnuPG currently treats the key as having all bits set (on), though the thing to note is that the keys with this sort of marker are very rare in the wild.The risks are unlikely today, and they are not particularly dangerous, but the keyholder's stated intent of separating out keys by context of use is being ignored, so there is a window of vulnerability that should not be open.References:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q3/599https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=484836https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=840510"

In order to restore thisrepresentation to python code while parsing the JSON, Djblets woulduse the eval() routine to execute them, leading to a risk of executingarbitrary code in the Review Board process.=== Affected Deployments ===All Djblets deployments (and therefore all existing Review Boarddeployments) are vulnerable to this flaw.=== Scope ===A remote attacker might be able to construct a JSON request containingmalicious python code that could be executed within the mod_wsgiprocess on the server. It is unknown to what extent it could causedamage, but denial-of-service at the minimum.=== Resolution ===Djblets will now use the literal_eval() routine instead of the eval()routine when run on platforms with Python 2.6 or later. Theliteral_eval() routine will sanitize the results such that onlyassignments of literal variables is permitted, as opposed to arbitrarypython code execution.Special note: If Djblets is installed on a platform runningPython 2.5 or earlier, this code will fall back to the earlier,less-secure eval() routine. Djblets upstream strongly recommendsmigrating such deployments to a more recent version of Python.It is noted that the primary consumer of this library - Review Board - is not believed to be vulnerable to this issue, as there are other safeguards in place. However, it is possible that other unknown consumers of this library are at risk.=== Acknowledgements ===Christian Hammond, lead upstream developer of Review Board is creditedwith discovering and correcting this vulnerability.=== Embargo Information ===Upstream has coordinated with packagers of various distributions and cloud application vendors to lift the embargo on Thursday, October 8, 2013. This BZ should become public at that time.Upstream has requested that Red Hat please coordinate the issuance of a CVE for this vulnerability."

        "description": "Description Ratul Gupta 2013-11-01 11:21:50 UTC Libgadu, an open library for communicating using the protocol e-mail, was found to have missing the ssl certificate validation. The issue is that libgadu uses openSSL library for creating secure connections. A program using openSSL can perform SSL handshake by invoking the SSL_connect function. Some cetrificate validation errors are signaled through, the return values of the SSL_connect, while for the others errors SSL_connect returns OK but sets internal \"verify result\" flags. Application must call ssl_get_verify_result function to check if any such errors occurred. This check seems to be missing in libgadu. And thus a man-in-the-middle attack is possible failing all the SSL protection.Upstream suggested that it was a concious decision as libgadu is reverse-engineered implementation of a proprietary protocol, they had no control over the certificates used for SSL connections, so they would add a note to the documentation about this.References:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q4/202https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=848509http://www.mail-archive.com/libgadu-devel@lists.ziew.org/msg01017.html"

In the recent months, a lot of different attacks have been discovered relying on inconsistencies between the handling of the Host header by various software (web servers, reverse proxies, web frameworks, ...). Basically, everytime the framework is generating an absolute URL (when sending an email to reset a password for instance), the host might have been manipulated by an attacker. And depending on the configuration of your web server, the Symfony Request::getHost() method might be vulnerable to some of these attacks.As these attacks depend on the web server configuration, the fact that you are using a reverse proxy or not, and many other factors, I recommend you to read more about this problem that affects frameworks in all languages, in the great and detailed blog post, Practical HTTP Host header attacks.

Storable is not secure across trust boundaries, see the warning that upstream added in Version 2.45. We should at least add a strong warning that PlRPC is equally unsafe.In addition, the instructions are overly optimistic. We don't seem to ship any really strong ciphers, and the API of the Crypt:: modules is not really a good match for authenticated encryption modes. (Unauthenticated tend to be vulnerable to all kinds of attacks.) There appears to be zero reply protection. Additionally, compression is enabled unconditionally, which can reveal message contents, especially in conjunction with chosen-ciphertext attacks."

Initially there were no checks involved in validatingthe name of the module, users could provide string and the kernel wouldattempt to load a module by that name in the default search path for thespecific version of the kernel.The proposed fix for CVE-2013-7421 solved the issue for the simple use case, however there was an additional attack vector which by changing the string formatting any module can still be loaded.External reference:https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/3/4/70https://plus.google.com/+MathiasKrause/posts/PqFCo4bfrWuhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/229Fixed with these 3 commits:https://git.kernel.org/linus/5d26a105b5a7https://git.kernel.org/linus/4943ba16bbc2https://git.kernel.org/linus/3e14dcf7cb80I have only done light testing and they seem to solve it for me."
